Of note this signature was derived using computational biology techniques to identify the most important set of “hub” genes (master genes that provide information on other genes), and also a selection of genes that had genetic changes or were functionally important.  The functionally important genes were identified based on our prior studies of siRNA screens that identify genes that were “synthetically lethal” when lung cancer cells were treated with taxane chemotherapy (if the gene function was taken away the lung cancer cells died but only in the presence of taxane chemotherapy).  Thus, the 18 gene prognostic/predictive signature is one of the first that is functionally important as well. ', N'Yang XIE, Hao TANG, Guanghua XIAO, Ignacio WISTUBA, John D.

Since its description in C. elegans and mammalian cells, use of siRNA as a method of gene silencing has rapidly become a powerful tool in protein function delineation, gene discovery, and drug development. The promise of specific RNA degradation has also generated much excitement for possible use as a therapeutic modality, but in vivo siRNA delivery has proven difficult. Delivery methods that are effective for other nucleic acids are not necessarily effective for siRNA.  Therefore, most studies using siRNA in vivo involve manipulation of gene expression in a cell line prior to introduction into an animal model, or incorporation of siRNA into a viral vector.  Delivery of “naked” siRNA in vivo has been restricted to site-specific injections or through high-pressure means that are not clinically practical.  One study that showed in vivo uptake and targeted downregulation of an endogenous protein by an siRNA after normal systemic dosing required chemical modification of the siRNA; however, this chemical modification has an unknown toxicity and may result in significant toxicity to a subject in vivo.  Further this chemical modification may affect siRNA activity and/or longevity. Cationic liposomes have been used to deliver siRNA to various cell types.  However, it is not clear if or to what degree neutral liposomes may be used deliver siRNA to a cell. Neutral liposomes have been tested to a limited degree.  However, it was not clear if or to what degree neutral liposomes may be used to deliver siRNA.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:

The present invention provides compositions and methods for delivery of a siRNA to a cell via a non-charged (neutral) liposome.  The inventors have discovered that non-charged liposomes may be used to efficiently deliver a siNA (e.g., an siRNA) to cells in vivo; further, delivery of siNA via neutral liposomes resulted in a significant (~10 fold) improvement in delivery as compared with cationic liposomes in vivo.  It has also been identified that the methods of the present invention may be particularly suited for the treatment of cancer.', N' Anil K. Sood, Gabriel Lopez-Berestein, Charles N.

Both acute and chronic opioid administration can produce tolerance, as indicated by a lowered responsiveness to the administration of this drug.  Drug tolerance necessitates higher doses, which can be associated with side effects that often limit long-term use.

Tolerance to the analgesic effects of narcotics remains a major impediment to the use of these drugs in the treatment of pain Also, pain due to nerve compression or nerve invasion is a prominent component of cancer pain, and is resistant to treatment with currently available narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics.

Current methods of treating opioid tolerance often involve the NMDA receptor and inhibiting it.  NMDA antagonists, however, have been found to be highly toxic and are only able to partially reverse morphine tolerance at best and cannot reverse established tolerance.  The high toxicity limits the clinical use of antagonists.  Hence, a need exists for compositions and methods for:  (1) the effective inhibition of the development of opioid tolerance; (2) reversal or reduction of opioid tolerance; (3) reducing opioid dependence; (4) effective inhibition of physical dependence; and (5) reducing or inhibition of addiction.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Methods of modulating Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor ("PDGFR") and/or Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (“EGFR”) for the treatment of opioid tolerance, physical dependence, chronic pain, addiction and related disorders are provided herein.  As described herein, methods of preventing, reducing and/or reversing opioid tolerance by administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a PDGFR or EGFR small molecule inhibitor formulated in a vehicle permitting the drug to cross the blood-brain barrier, alone or in combination, and/or in combination with morphine or another opiate analgesic drug or narcotic are provided.  As such, these combination therapies can be further facilitated by a formulation of the drug product(s) with cyclodextrin and cyclodextrin derivatives.

Furthermore, many types of compounds which possess PDGFR inhibiting activity or EGFR inhibiting activity can be useful in the treatment of opioid tolerance, physical dependence, pain, addiction and related disorders  Therefore, as described herein, methods of treatment are provided wherein the method comprises the step of administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a PDGFR or EGFR inhibitor and administered, alone, or in combination with morphine or another opiate analgesic drugs or narcotics.

The reaction is very sensitive and activated within seconds after the two agents are brought in contact with each other19. The generated oxygen accumulates within the limited volume of the microfluidics channels and causes an increase in pressure, which pushes preloaded inked bars. The advancement of each individual inked bar independently indicates the amount of catalase that reacted in that ELISA well, which correlates with the concentration of the corresponding ELISA target19. This approach allows for the measurement of target protein biomarkers in both a quantitative and multiplexed manner.

This construct comprises a trastuzumab full length antibody (human IgG1-derived) with single chain Fv fragments specific for HER3 (Ab6) linked to the two CH3 domains of the antibody.  Trastuzumab is specific for HER2 and is FDA approved as a treatment for breast cancer. The anti-HER3 antibody sequence was derived from a patent (US 0266584; Schoeberl et al., inventors) describing anti-HER3 antibodies. The expression construct for the bispecific antibody (called TAb6 for Trastuzumab-Ab6) has been made by us using the published/patented antibody sequences. We observe that in the presence of the HER3 stimulatory ligand, heregulin, that is frequently present in tumors, TAb6 combined with the small molecule tyrosine inhibitor lapatinib is highly effective in reducing tumor cell proliferation and HER3 signaling in breast cancer cell lines. Importantly, TAb6 is more effective than the individual antibodies (trastuzumab or Ab6, or trastuzumab plus Ab6) with lapatinib. Thus, we believe that this bispecific antibody has considerable potential for use in therapy. This is particularly so given the low response rate in breast cancer patients to trastuzumab.

A rigorous expression of a weighting function has been derived directly from a photoacoustic wave equation and used as a unique ramp filter in the Fourier space. In contrast to conventional filtered backprojection methods that rely on empirically selected window functions as filters, our new algorithm utilizes the mathematically determined weighting function to precisely count the contribution from a photoacoustic signal for the image reconstruction in Fourier domain. In addition, an adaptive criterion has been derived for selecting a cutoff frequency in Fourier domain based on the weighting function and the used sampling rate. The treated data are then converted back to the time domain through inverse Fourier transform and are then used for backprojection. Utilizing this new algorithm, we have conducted a series of numerical simulations on different phantom samples.

Since its description in C. elegans and mammalian cells, use of siRNA as a method of gene silencing has rapidly become a powerful tool in protein function delineation, gene discovery, and drug development. The promise of specific RNA degradation has also generated much excitement for possible use as a therapeutic modality, but in vivo siRNA delivery has proven difficult. Delivery methods that are effective for other nucleic acids are not necessarily effective for siRNA.  Therefore, most studies using siRNA in vivo involve manipulation of gene expression in a cell line prior to introduction into an animal model, or incorporation of siRNA into a viral vector.  Delivery of “naked” siRNA in vivo has been restricted to site-specific injections or through high-pressure means that are not clinically practical.  One study that showed in vivo uptake and targeted downregulation of an endogenous protein by an siRNA after normal systemic dosing required chemical modification of the siRNA; however, this chemical modification has an unknown toxicity and may result in significant toxicity to a subject in vivo.  Further this chemical modification may affect siRNA activity and/or longevity. Cationic liposomes have been used to deliver siRNA to various cell types.  However, it is not clear if or to what degree neutral liposomes may be used deliver siRNA to a cell. Neutral liposomes have been tested to a limited degree.

This led us to the development of texaphyrin-platinum conjugates that are designed to address these issues. This conjugate was found to be significantly more cytotoxic than cisplatin in both resistant ovarian cancer models. Most importantly, no resistance was observed, and, to our knowledge, this is a first for small molecule platinum agents. It was also found that this conjugate is capable of delivering much more platinum into the resistant cancer cell than any FDA approved platinum agent. Due to the type of platinum agent (similar to oxaliplatin) on the conjugate, the platinum-DNA adducts being formed were very efficient at inducing cell death. We found that cell death (i.e. apoptosis) was being induced similar to that of oxaliplatin and all of the molecular checkpoints for this process were met. While cell death caused by our conjugate is similar to oxaliplatin, it should be emphasized that the conjugate was found to be capable of delivering much more platinum into the cell than oxaliplatin.

This construct comprises a trastuzumab full length antibody (human IgG1-derived) with single chain Fv fragments specific for HER3 (Ab6) linked to the two CH3 domains of the antibody.  Trastuzumab is specific for HER2 and is FDA approved as a treatment for breast cancer. The anti-HER3 antibody sequence was derived from a patent (US 0266584; Schoeberl et al., inventors) describing anti-HER3 antibodies. The expression construct for the bispecific antibody (called TAb6 for Trastuzumab-Ab6) has been made by us using the published/patented antibody sequences. We observe that in the presence of the HER3 stimulatory ligand, heregulin, that is frequently present in tumors, TAb6 combined with the small molecule tyrosine inhibitor lapatinib is highly effective in reducing tumor cell proliferation and HER3 signaling in breast cancer cell lines. Importantly, TAb6 is more effective than the individual antibodies (trastuzumab or Ab6, or trastuzumab plus Ab6) with lapatinib. Thus, we believe that this bispecific antibody has considerable potential for use in therapy. This is particularly so given the low response rate in breast cancer patients to trastuzumab.

reconstruction in photoacoustic tomography. A rigorous expression of a weighting
function has been derived directly from a photoacoustic wave equation and used as a
unique ramp filter in the Fourier space. In contrast to conventional filtered backprojection
methods that rely on empirically selected window functions as filters, our new algorithm
utilizes the mathematically determined weighting function to precisely count the
contribution from a photoacoustic signal for the image reconstruction in Fourier domain.
In addition, an adaptive criterion has been derived for selecting a cutoff frequency in
Fourier domain based on the weighting function and the used sampling rate. The treated
data are then converted back to the time domain through inverse Fourier transform and
are then used for backprojection. Utilizing this new algorithm, we have conducted a
series of numerical simulations on different phantom samples. Our results have
demonstrated the effectiveness of using this method for image reconstruction in
photoacoustic tomography with significantly improved image quality.', N'He Huang and Jing Yong Ye

Our laboratory develops covalent inhibitors targeted to proteins involved in cancer. Currently the major focus is targeting cancer-related kinases and GTPases such as K-Ras. Specific examples that we work on currently include ErbB3, TAK1 and K-Ras G12C because these targets contain a reactive cysteine in the protein active site that is the chemical target for covalent addition. In the development of covalent inhibitors, the current standard means of detecting a covalent interaction between protein targets and test compounds is mass spectrometry which is  time consuming and expensive. The invention described here consists of chemical probes that are reactive with the target cysteine and go from being undetectable to detectable once that reaction occurs. To date we have used chemicals that give colorimetric (Elman’s reagent-5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) and fluorescent (CPM-7-Diethylamino-3-(4-maleimidophenyl)-4-methylcoumarin) signals upon reacting with the target cysteine and a range of other similar compounds which exhibit a change in fluorescence upon reaction with free cysteines could be used in this assay (eg DACM-N-(7-Dimethylamino-4-Methylcoumarin-3-yl))Maleimide; N-(1-pyrene)maleimide; and Monobromobimane). This technique allows biochemical assays which assess the ability of a test compound to form a covalent bond with a target protein. If the covalent reaction occurs with the test compound then the cysteine will be unavailable to react with the chemical probe, but if the covalent reaction fails to occur, the cysteine will be available for interaction with the chemical probe and a resulting colorimetric or fluorescent signal. The linearity of the assay signal as well as the rapid reaction with the chemical probe (<1min) further allow accurate determination of the percent labeling by test compounds at multiple time points and a kinetic determination of the rate of covalent bond formation, which is useful in prioritizing test compounds.  To ensure specificity, the assay requires mutation of any non-target solvent accessible cysteines in the target protein which may react non-specifically with the probe.', N'Westover, Hunter', NULL, NULL, N'Patent application 62006622', 2, N'Detection of Irreversible Inhibitor Binding by Chemical Probes', NULL, 87, CAST(N'2019-04-30' AS Date))

Since ionizing radiation uses a general killing mechanism of DNA damage, it is generally not prone to problems of chemotherapy, such as acquired resistance or poor blood flow.


A major limiting factor in delivering the appropriate tumoricidal dose of radiation is normal tissue toxicity.    This issue is highlighted by solid tumors of the abdomen and pelvis, such as pancreatic and prostate adenocarcinoma, which often cannot achieve tumoricidal doses of radiation without significant morbidity to the GI tract.


For instance, pancreatic cancer often occurs in the head of the pancreas, which shares a blood supply with the duodenum, a very radiosensitive portion of the intestinal tract.  Pancreatic tumors are quite resistant to radiation and require doses in excess of 60 to 70 Gy of localized fractionated radiotherapy to achieve
>95% tumor control.  Unfortunately, these doses cannot be delivered safely since the nearby duodenum has a maximum dose limit of about 50 Gy.  Physicians are reticent to push the dose much further than this
since a small ulcer or perforation of the intestines would almost certainly lead to significant morbidity, if
not mortality. The proximity of the duodenum to the pancreas is shown in Figure 1.


Unfortunately for patients with pancreatic cancer, there are no effective treatments that specifically protect the GI tract from radiotoxicity.  Amifostine is FDA-approved for intravenous administration. However,  when administered intravenously,  Amifostine  has  an  undesirable side  effect profile, most notably hypotension that has caused the drug to fall out of favor with clinicians.

Embodiments of the disclosure encompass immune cells that express a HER2-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and uses thereof.  In certain aspects, the CAR comprises a scFv specific for HER2.  In particular embodiments, the CAR utilizes a single chain variable fragmeny (scFv) specific for HER2 that is known in the art, although in other embodiments, the CAR does not utilize an scFv specific for HER2 that is known in the art.  The CAR may be a second generation or third generation CAR, but in specific embodiments the CAR is not a third generation CAR and comprises only one costimulatory endodomain.

In specific embodiments, an individual is given a certain type of immunotherapy for treating and preventing HER2-positive cancer, such as an immune cell that recognizes HER2. In specific embodiments, the immune cell is a T cell, NK cell, or NKT cell.  In specific embodiments the immune cells comprise HER2-specific CAR and may be further modified other than the HER2-specific CAR.. Another genetic modification of the immune cells is to express one or more chemokine receptors, such that they are utilized to enhance T-cell homing to tumor sites, for example.  In specific embodiments of the CAR T cells, one can transgenically express one or more stimulatory cytokines.  In certain embodiments, one can render HER2-CAR T cells resistant to an inhibitory tumor microenvironment. One may also avoid ‘on target/off cancer’ toxicity with genetic modifications to increase safety, such as an inducible suicide gene and/or inhibitory receptors to limit the effector function of T cells to tumor sites.

In particular embodiments, an individual in need thereof, such as one that is known to have a HER2-positive cancer or suspected of having a HER2-positive cancer, is provided a therapeutically effective amount of immune cells encompassed by the disclosure.  Multiple administrations of cells may be provided to the individual.  In certain embodiments, one does or does not use lymphodepleting chemotherapy or irradiation prior to T-cell transfer.

While anti-folate agents
have been widely used to shrink tumors, this IPQ discloses that they are much more effective in
preventing metastasis because metastasizing cells are particularly dependent on the folate

pathway including ALDH1L1 and ALDH1L2, will kill metastasizing cells, delay disease
progression, and increase the survival of patients with melanoma and possibly other solid
malignancies.
Currently, no therapeutic strategies that specifically target metastasizing melanoma cells have
been reported. The discovery that metastasizing melanoma cells rely on NADPH-generating
folate pathway enzymes ALDH1L1 and ALDH1L2 is unique. This offers the opportunity to
specifically target metastasizing melanoma cells by exacerbating their oxidative stress, for

Since its description in C. elegans and mammalian cells, use of siRNA as a method of gene silencing has rapidly become a powerful tool in protein function delineation, gene discovery, and drug development. The promise of specific RNA degradation has also generated much excitement for possible use as a therapeutic modality, but in vivo siRNA delivery has proven difficult. Delivery methods that are effective for other nucleic acids are not necessarily effective for siRNA.  Therefore, most studies using siRNA in vivo involve manipulation of gene expression in a cell line prior to introduction into an animal model, or incorporation of siRNA into a viral vector.  Delivery of “naked” siRNA in vivo has been restricted to site-specific injections or through high-pressure means that are not clinically practical.  One study that showed in vivo uptake and targeted downregulation of an endogenous protein by an siRNA after normal systemic dosing required chemical modification of the siRNA; however, this chemical modification has an unknown toxicity and may result in significant toxicity to a subject in vivo.  Further this chemical modification may affect siRNA activity and/or longevity. Cationic liposomes have been used to deliver siRNA to various cell types.  However, it is not clear if or to what degree neutral liposomes may be used deliver siRNA to a cell. Neutral liposomes have been tested to a limited degree.

The design employs catalase as the ELISA probe, which is conjugated to silica nanoparticles functionalized with ELISA detection antibodies. Catalase reacts with hydrogen peroxide to release oxygen. The reaction is very sensitive and activated within seconds after the two agents are brought in contact with each other19. The generated oxygen accumulates within the limited volume of the microfluidics channels and causes an increase in pressure, which pushes preloaded inked bars. The advancement of each individual inked bar independently indicates the amount of catalase that reacted in that ELISA well, which correlates with the concentration of the corresponding ELISA target19. This approach allows for the measurement of target protein biomarkers in both a quantitative and multiplexed manner.

A rigorous expression of a weighting function has been derived directly from a photoacoustic wave equation and used as a unique ramp filter in the Fourier space.

In addition, an adaptive criterion has been derived for selecting a cutoff frequency in Fourier domain based on the weighting function and the used sampling rate. The treated data are then converted back to the time domain through inverse Fourier transform and are then used for backprojection. Utilizing this new algorithm, we have conducted a series of numerical simulations on different phantom samples.

Exosomes in the tumor microenvironment may play a key role in facilitating of cell-cell communication. Exosomes are reported to predominantly contain RNA and proteins. In this study, we investigated whether exosomes from pancreatic cancer cells and serum of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma contain genomic DNA. Our results provide evidence that exosomes contain long fragments of double-stranded genomic DNA. Mutations in KRAS and p53 can be detected using genomic DNA from exosomes derived from pancreatic cancer cell lines and serum of patients with pancreatic cancer. In addition, using whole genome sequencing, we demonstrate that serum exosomes from patients with pancreatic cancer contain genomic DNA spanning all chromosomes.

Therefore, PDAC is in urgent need of effective new therapies. Genetic analyses of PDAC show that mutations in RAS family of small GTPases (KrasG12/D/R/V) are encountered in 70% and up to 96% of patients and are key drivers of tumor growth and metastasis. Genetic manipulations in mice have shown that dampening oncogenic KRAS reverses tumor progression. Oncogenic KRAS signaling and increased RAS activity have emerged as initiating driver of pancreas neoplasia, however RAS remains an intractable target and a therapy challenge. Here, exosomes derived from normal fibroblasts were engineered to carry RNA interference (RNAi) payloads to target oncogenic KRASG12D. Exosomes containing siRNA or shRNA against KrasG12D  efficiently entered cancer cells and specifically suppressed oncogenic Ras, attenuating ERK activation, inhibiting proliferation and inducing cancer cell apoptosis. Liposomes were not as affecting highlighting the systemic delivery challenges associated with RNA interference constructs. Systemic delivery of exosomes with KrasG12D targeting cargo show robust pancreas localization and suppression of pre-established orthotopic human pancreas tumors as well as tumors in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of pancreas cancer, together with an improvement in survival, when compared to liposomes containing si/sh RNA and exosomes with scrambled RNAi constructs. We show that one reason why liposomes do not work as efficiently to deliver RNAi constructs is because they recruit more monocytes and get phagocytosed via toll like receptors. Tumors of mice treated with si/sh RNA containing exosomes displayed significant decrease in downstream RAS signal mediators and improved histopathological findings with normal pancreas histology. Collectively, this report offers new possibilities for direct, specific and efficient targeting of oncogenic RAS in pancreas cancer using engineered exosomes.

The presence of many components of the mRNA translation machinery in exosomes from normal and cancer cells, such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), free amino acids and eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), prompted us to evaluate their intrinsic capacity to produce functional proteins in cell-free conditions. Exosomes incubated with 35S-methionine produce several labeled proteins, which are sensitive to cycloheximide inhibition. The presence of RNA polymerase II prompted us to evaluate DNA transcription as well as translation. Exosomes were directly electroporated with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) expression plasmid and GFP protein was detected in the exosomes by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. GFP protein production was inhibited by -amanitin or cyclohexamide. Using a bicistronic reporter construct we demonstrate exosome translation is cap-dependent. Exosomes derived from MDA-MB231 cells, which lack wild type p53 protein, electroporated with a wild type p53-GFP fusion plasmid, led to reactivation of p21 when delivered to naïve MDA-MB231 cells. This suggests that proteins produced in exosomes are biologically active. Collectively, this report provides unprecedented evidence for cell-independent DNA transcription and mRNA translation in exosomes. While the implications of this need further unraveling, these observations suggest a functional role for exosomes in facilitating cell-cell communication via de novo synthesis and delivery of proteins.

Conventional drug development approaches exclusively targeting protein biomolecules such as receptors, enzymes, hormones etc. As an alternative approach we identified a peptide-peptoid hybrid PPS1 that is mainly targeting phosphatidylserine (PS), a lipid that predominantly express on outer layer of tumor cells, tumor endothelium and apoptotic cells as opposed to normal cells in the body, where PS is limited to inner layer of the cell membrane. Since PS is universally found in tumors, this has been considered as a global target for potential cancer therapeutics.
The simple dimeric version of this compound (PPS1D1) displays much improvement (about 175-fold) with binding at 80 nM (FACS studies) on these HCC4017 lung cancer cells. PPS1 pull down HCC4017 cells as well as a spectrum of lung cancer lines (about 10 cell lines) very selectively over normal HBEC30-kt and HBEC-3kt cells, validated on magnetic bead pull down assay.
On the activity side, PPS1D1 and few of its new derivatives display strong in vitro cancer cell killing activity on lung cancer (e.g. HCC4017, H460, H358, H441, H1819, H1993, H2122 cells), breast cancer (MD-MB-231 cells) and prostate cancer (PC3 cells), validated to date using standard MTS cell viability assays and FACS studies. Recent in vivo studies indicated that PPS1D1strongly accumulated in HCC4017 tumor xenograpfts in mice. PPS1D1 displayed strong tumor burden effect on H460 lung cancer xenografts, even better than docetaxel – a standard chemotherapy. More importantly, the combination treatment of PPS1D1 with Docetaxel almost wiped-out the tumor.
PS has been reported as a universal biomarker for tumors and tumor-microenvironment and following radiation and chemotherapy therapy, up to 95% of the tumor vessels can become PS-positive, making this an ideal and global candidate for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Also PS is known to express viral as well as infected cells, and therefore applications can be extended to anti-viral therapy as well. Furthermore, these peptoids are serum stable, non-immunogenic, highly diverse, more economical to synthesize and can be optimized at will, displaying precious collection of drug like characteristics. Finally, cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths in US today and developing economical, biologically amenable and high specific agents targeting cancer at a ‘global level’ for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications are the top most clinical markets in US today.

More than 400 coactivators have been identified and associated with a wide range of human diseases, including neurological and metabolic disorders, inflammatory diseases, and cancer.  Steroid receptor coactivators contain three family members, including SRC-1, SRC-2 and SRC-3, which function cooperatively to regulate many cellular signaling pathways.  Taking estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer as an example, cancer cells can employ a number of mechanisms to overcome selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) to silence the nuclear receptor (NR) activity.  Although breast cancer cells can become resistant to endocrine therapies, it is essential for these cancer cells to recruit coactivators to survive.  Coactivators also partner with other transcription factors; therefore, small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) that can directly target the overexpressed coactivators and reduce their activity or stability are targets for drug development.  In addition, stimulation of coactivators can be beneficial for certain pathological conditions, including cancer, and can also be beneficial for the treatment of metabolic disorders.

S1) onto pH insensitive near infrared emitting glutathione coated AuNPs (GS-AuNPs) (FIG. 1A).  When the pH increased from 6 to 10, the emission intensity of TAMRA increased over five-fold, while the emission intensity of GS-AuNPs only changed less than 10%. Thus, the emission ratio of TAMRA to GS-AuNP was found to linearly depend on the pH of local environment. Photophysical spectroscopic studies show that this pH dependent emission of TAMRA originates from its dimerization on the AuNPs, of which the geometry was highly sensitive to the protonation of glutathione on AuNPs. Not limited to pH insensitive dyes, a well-known pH sensitive dye, fluorescein, became even more sensitive to pH changes within a larger pH range after being conjugated to GS-AuNPs. These results clearly indicate that this unique synergy arising from conjugation of organic dyes onto luminescent AuNPs offers a new pathway to design ultrasmall ratiometric pH-responsive nanoindicators.

Degradons have three components: proteasome binding base, linker, and substrate targeting head.  Implementations with different bases, linkers and targeting heads are possible.  Degradons can be constructed from different materials, including proteins and non-proteinaceous materials.
-The most common current technology to deplete proteins from cells is to prevent their synthesis, for example by RNA interference.  Proteins deplete with the rate at which they turn over naturally, which can be very slow.  Proteasome adaptors act on proteins that already exist and induce their degradation by shuttling them to the main cellular protein degradation machinery.  Proteasome adaptors are able to differentiate between pools of proteins synthesized from the same gene but modified post-translationally.
-Several technologies have been developed that target proteins for degradation by the proteasome by inducing their ubiquitination.  Ubiquitinated proteins are then recognized by the proteasome and degraded.  Ubiquitin also targets proteins to processes other than degradation and we do not fully understand the targeting code.  Depleting the cellular ubiquitin pool has pleiotropic effects on cells.  Proteasome adaptors sidesteps ubiquitination and targets proteins directly to the main proteolytic machinery in the cell, the proteasome.

Since its description in C. elegans and mammalian cells, use of siRNA as a method of gene silencing has rapidly become a powerful tool in protein function delineation, gene discovery, and drug development. The promise of specific RNA degradation has also generated much excitement for possible use as a therapeutic modality, but in vivo siRNA delivery has proven difficult. Delivery methods that are effective for other nucleic acids are not necessarily effective for siRNA.  Therefore, most studies using siRNA in vivo involve manipulation of gene expression in a cell line prior to introduction into an animal model, or incorporation of siRNA into a viral vector.  Delivery of “naked” siRNA in vivo has been restricted to site-specific injections or through high-pressure means that are not clinically practical.  One study that showed in vivo uptake and targeted downregulation of an endogenous protein by an siRNA after normal systemic dosing required chemical modification of the siRNA; however, this chemical modification has an unknown toxicity and may result in significant toxicity to a subject in vivo.  Further this chemical modification may affect siRNA activity and/or longevity. Cationic liposomes have been used to deliver siRNA to various cell types.  However, it is not clear if or to what degree neutral liposomes may be used deliver siRNA to a cell. Neutral liposomes have been tested to a limited degree.

Exosomes in the tumor microenvironment may play a key role in facilitating of cell-cell communication. Exosomes are reported to predominantly contain RNA and proteins. In this study, we investigated whether exosomes from pancreatic cancer cells and serum of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma contain genomic DNA. Our results provide evidence that exosomes contain long fragments of double-stranded genomic DNA. Mutations in KRAS and p53 can be detected using genomic DNA from exosomes derived from pancreatic cancer cell lines and serum of patients with pancreatic cancer. In addition, using whole genome sequencing, we demonstrate that serum exosomes from patients with pancreatic cancer contain genomic DNA spanning all chromosomes.

Therefore, PDAC is in urgent need of effective new therapies. Genetic analyses of PDAC show that mutations in RAS family of small GTPases (KrasG12/D/R/V) are encountered in 70% and up to 96% of patients and are key drivers of tumor growth and metastasis. Genetic manipulations in mice have shown that dampening oncogenic KRAS reverses tumor progression. Oncogenic KRAS signaling and increased RAS activity have emerged as initiating driver of pancreas neoplasia, however RAS remains an intractable target and a therapy challenge. Here, exosomes derived from normal fibroblasts were engineered to carry RNA interference (RNAi) payloads to target oncogenic KRASG12D. Exosomes containing siRNA or shRNA against KrasG12D  efficiently entered cancer cells and specifically suppressed oncogenic Ras, attenuating ERK activation, inhibiting proliferation and inducing cancer cell apoptosis. Liposomes were not as affecting highlighting the systemic delivery challenges associated with RNA interference constructs. Systemic delivery of exosomes with KrasG12D targeting cargo show robust pancreas localization and suppression of pre-established orthotopic human pancreas tumors as well as tumors in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of pancreas cancer, together with an improvement in survival, when compared to liposomes containing si/sh RNA and exosomes with scrambled RNAi constructs. We show that one reason why liposomes do not work as efficiently to deliver RNAi constructs is because they recruit more monocytes and get phagocytosed via toll like receptors. Tumors of mice treated with si/sh RNA containing exosomes displayed significant decrease in downstream RAS signal mediators and improved histopathological findings with normal pancreas histology. Collectively, this report offers new possibilities for direct, specific and efficient targeting of oncogenic RAS in pancreas cancer using engineered exosomes.

The presence of many components of the mRNA translation machinery in exosomes from normal and cancer cells, such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), free amino acids and eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), prompted us to evaluate their intrinsic capacity to produce functional proteins in cell-free conditions. Exosomes incubated with 35S-methionine produce several labeled proteins, which are sensitive to cycloheximide inhibition. The presence of RNA polymerase II prompted us to evaluate DNA transcription as well as translation. Exosomes were directly electroporated with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) expression plasmid and GFP protein was detected in the exosomes by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. GFP protein production was inhibited by -amanitin or cyclohexamide. Using a bicistronic reporter construct we demonstrate exosome translation is cap-dependent. Exosomes derived from MDA-MB231 cells, which lack wild type p53 protein, electroporated with a wild type p53-GFP fusion plasmid, led to reactivation of p21 when delivered to naïve MDA-MB231 cells. This suggests that proteins produced in exosomes are biologically active. Collectively, this report provides unprecedented evidence for cell-independent DNA transcription and mRNA translation in exosomes. While the implications of this need further unraveling, these observations suggest a functional role for exosomes in facilitating cell-cell communication via de novo synthesis and delivery of proteins.

By controlling the electrical length of the transmissionline connecting each of the coils to the common voltage point to an odd integer multiple of one quarter wavelength, the current delivered to each coil is independent of coil impedance.   This principle of forced current excitation enables equal currents to be delivered to each coil of a magnetic resonance imaging transmit coil array regardless of the unique loading of the individual coils an mutual impedance between the coils.    This will be advantageous in high-field MRI where the coils are very sensitive to interaction with the patient due to electromagnetic effects at the higher radio-frequencies associated with high-field MRI.', N'Mary P.

Since ionizing radiation uses a general killing mechanism of DNA damage, it is generally not prone to problems of chemotherapy, such as acquired resistance or poor blood flow.


A major limiting factor in delivering the appropriate tumoricidal dose of radiation is normal tissue toxicity.    This issue is highlighted by solid tumors of the abdomen and pelvis, such as pancreatic and prostate adenocarcinoma, which often cannot achieve tumoricidal doses of radiation without significant morbidity to the GI tract.


For instance, pancreatic cancer often occurs in the head of the pancreas, which shares a blood supply with the duodenum, a very radiosensitive portion of the intestinal tract.  Pancreatic tumors are quite resistant to radiation and require doses in excess of 60 to 70 Gy of localized fractionated radiotherapy to achieve
>95% tumor control.  Unfortunately, these doses cannot be delivered safely since the nearby duodenum has a maximum dose limit of about 50 Gy.  Physicians are reticent to push the dose much further than this
since a small ulcer or perforation of the intestines would almost certainly lead to significant morbidity, if
not mortality. The proximity of the duodenum to the pancreas is shown in Figure 1.


Unfortunately for patients with pancreatic cancer, there are no effective treatments that specifically protect the GI tract from radiotoxicity.  Amifostine is FDA-approved for intravenous administration. However,  when administered intravenously,  Amifostine  has  an  undesirable side  effect profile, most notably hypotension that has caused the drug to fall out of favor with clinicians.

SCD is an essential enzyme for cancers, so it represents an attractive drug target. However, its inhibition in the skin is toxic. The significance of our discovery is that these compounds are delivered as inert prodrugs and are activated by the tumor into potent SCD inhibitors. They therefore show an improved therapeutic index relative to systemically active SCD inhibitors.

Conventional drug development approaches exclusively targeting protein biomolecules such as receptors, enzymes, hormones etc. As an alternative approach we identified a peptide-peptoid hybrid PPS1 that is mainly targeting phosphatidylserine (PS), a lipid that predominantly express on outer layer of tumor cells, tumor endothelium and apoptotic cells as opposed to normal cells in the body, where PS is limited to inner layer of the cell membrane. Since PS is universally found in tumors, this has been considered as a global target for potential cancer therapeutics.
The simple dimeric version of this compound (PPS1D1) displays much improvement (about 175-fold) with binding at 80 nM (FACS studies) on these HCC4017 lung cancer cells. PPS1 pull down HCC4017 cells as well as a spectrum of lung cancer lines (about 10 cell lines) very selectively over normal HBEC30-kt and HBEC-3kt cells, validated on magnetic bead pull down assay.
On the activity side, PPS1D1 and few of its new derivatives display strong in vitro cancer cell killing activity on lung cancer (e.g. HCC4017, H460, H358, H441, H1819, H1993, H2122 cells), breast cancer (MD-MB-231 cells) and prostate cancer (PC3 cells), validated to date using standard MTS cell viability assays and FACS studies. Recent in vivo studies indicated that PPS1D1strongly accumulated in HCC4017 tumor xenograpfts in mice. PPS1D1 displayed strong tumor burden effect on H460 lung cancer xenografts, even better than docetaxel – a standard chemotherapy. More importantly, the combination treatment of PPS1D1 with Docetaxel almost wiped-out the tumor.
PS has been reported as a universal biomarker for tumors and tumor-microenvironment and following radiation and chemotherapy therapy, up to 95% of the tumor vessels can become PS-positive, making this an ideal and global candidate for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Also PS is known to express viral as well as infected cells, and therefore applications can be extended to anti-viral therapy as well. Furthermore, these peptoids are serum stable, non-immunogenic, highly diverse, more economical to synthesize and can be optimized at will, displaying precious collection of drug like characteristics. Finally, cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths in US today and developing economical, biologically amenable and high specific agents targeting cancer at a ‘global level’ for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications are the top most clinical markets in US today.

Of note this signature was derived using computational biology techniques to identify the most important set of “hub” genes (master genes that provide information on other genes), and also a selection of genes that had genetic changes or were functionally important.  The functionally important genes were identified based on our prior studies of siRNA screens that identify genes that were “synthetically lethal” when lung cancer cells were treated with taxane chemotherapy (if the gene function was taken away the lung cancer cells died but only in the presence of taxane chemotherapy).

S1) onto pH insensitive near infrared emitting glutathione coated AuNPs (GS-AuNPs) (FIG. 1A).  When the pH increased from 6 to 10, the emission intensity of TAMRA increased over five-fold, while the emission intensity of GS-AuNPs only changed less than 10%. Thus, the emission ratio of TAMRA to GS-AuNP was found to linearly depend on the pH of local environment. Photophysical spectroscopic studies show that this pH dependent emission of TAMRA originates from its dimerization on the AuNPs, of which the geometry was highly sensitive to the protonation of glutathione on AuNPs. Not limited to pH insensitive dyes, a well-known pH sensitive dye, fluorescein, became even more sensitive to pH changes within a larger pH range after being conjugated to GS-AuNPs. These results clearly indicate that this unique synergy arising from conjugation of organic dyes onto luminescent AuNPs offers a new pathway to design ultrasmall ratiometric pH-responsive nanoindicators.

Since its description in C. elegans and mammalian cells, use of siRNA as a method of gene silencing has rapidly become a powerful tool in protein function delineation, gene discovery, and drug development. The promise of specific RNA degradation has also generated much excitement for possible use as a therapeutic modality, but in vivo siRNA delivery has proven difficult. Delivery methods that are effective for other nucleic acids are not necessarily effective for siRNA.  Therefore, most studies using siRNA in vivo involve manipulation of gene expression in a cell line prior to introduction into an animal model, or incorporation of siRNA into a viral vector.  Delivery of “naked” siRNA in vivo has been restricted to site-specific injections or through high-pressure means that are not clinically practical.  One study that showed in vivo uptake and targeted downregulation of an endogenous protein by an siRNA after normal systemic dosing required chemical modification of the siRNA; however, this chemical modification has an unknown toxicity and may result in significant toxicity to a subject in vivo.  Further this chemical modification may affect siRNA activity and/or longevity. Cationic liposomes have been used to deliver siRNA to various cell types.  However, it is not clear if or to what degree neutral liposomes may be used deliver siRNA to a cell. Neutral liposomes have been tested to a limited degree.  However, it was not clear if or to what degree neutral liposomes may be used to deliver siRNA.', N'Anil K. Sood, Gabriel Lopez-Berestein, Charles N.

Exosomes in the tumor microenvironment may play a key role in facilitating of cell-cell communication. Exosomes are reported to predominantly contain RNA and proteins. In this study, we investigated whether exosomes from pancreatic cancer cells and serum of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma contain genomic DNA. Our results provide evidence that exosomes contain long fragments of double-stranded genomic DNA. Mutations in KRAS and p53 can be detected using genomic DNA from exosomes derived from pancreatic cancer cell lines and serum of patients with pancreatic cancer.

Therefore, PDAC is in urgent need of effective new therapies. Genetic analyses of PDAC show that mutations in RAS family of small GTPases (KrasG12/D/R/V) are encountered in 70% and up to 96% of patients and are key drivers of tumor growth and metastasis. Genetic manipulations in mice have shown that dampening oncogenic KRAS reverses tumor progression. Oncogenic KRAS signaling and increased RAS activity have emerged as initiating driver of pancreas neoplasia, however RAS remains an intractable target and a therapy challenge. Here, exosomes derived from normal fibroblasts were engineered to carry RNA interference (RNAi) payloads to target oncogenic KRASG12D. Exosomes containing siRNA or shRNA against KrasG12D  efficiently entered cancer cells and specifically suppressed oncogenic Ras, attenuating ERK activation, inhibiting proliferation and inducing cancer cell apoptosis. Liposomes were not as affecting highlighting the systemic delivery challenges associated with RNA interference constructs. Systemic delivery of exosomes with KrasG12D targeting cargo show robust pancreas localization and suppression of pre-established orthotopic human pancreas tumors as well as tumors in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of pancreas cancer, together with an improvement in survival, when compared to liposomes containing si/sh RNA and exosomes with scrambled RNAi constructs. We show that one reason why liposomes do not work as efficiently to deliver RNAi constructs is because they recruit more monocytes and get phagocytosed via toll like receptors. Tumors of mice treated with si/sh RNA containing exosomes displayed significant decrease in downstream RAS signal mediators and improved histopathological findings with normal pancreas histology. Collectively, this report offers new possibilities for direct, specific and efficient targeting of oncogenic RAS in pancreas cancer using engineered exosomes.

The presence of many components of the mRNA translation machinery in exosomes from normal and cancer cells, such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), free amino acids and eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), prompted us to evaluate their intrinsic capacity to produce functional proteins in cell-free conditions. Exosomes incubated with 35S-methionine produce several labeled proteins, which are sensitive to cycloheximide inhibition. The presence of RNA polymerase II prompted us to evaluate DNA transcription as well as translation. Exosomes were directly electroporated with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) expression plasmid and GFP protein was detected in the exosomes by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. GFP protein production was inhibited by -amanitin or cyclohexamide. Using a bicistronic reporter construct we demonstrate exosome translation is cap-dependent. Exosomes derived from MDA-MB231 cells, which lack wild type p53 protein, electroporated with a wild type p53-GFP fusion plasmid, led to reactivation of p21 when delivered to naïve MDA-MB231 cells. This suggests that proteins produced in exosomes are biologically active. Collectively, this report provides unprecedented evidence for cell-independent DNA transcription and mRNA translation in exosomes. While the implications of this need further unraveling, these observations suggest a functional role for exosomes in facilitating cell-cell communication via de novo synthesis and delivery of proteins.

The present disclosure relates generally to the fields of medicine, oncology, and immunology. More particular, the disclosure relates to antibodies that LILRBs and can treat cancers, including leukemias.

Background

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia of adults. Despite continuous treatment, most patients relapse within 5 years. To effectively treat acute leukemia, new molecular targets and therapeutic approaches must be identified. Recently, the inventors cloned the human leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2 (LILRB2) as a receptor for several angiopoietin-like proteins (Angptls) (Zheng et al, 2012). The LILRB family receptors are type I transmembrane glycoprotein containing extracellular Ig-like domains that bind ligands and intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and are classified as inhibitory receptors because ITIM motifs can recruit phosphatases SHP-1, SHP-2, or SHIP to negatively regulate immune cell activation (Takai et al , 2011; Daeron et al, 2008; Katz et al, 2006). It is known that LILRBs are expressed on myeloid cells and certain other hematopoietic cells (Mori et al, 2008). Surprisingly, the inventors have shown that PirB, the mouse ortholog of LILRB2, and LAIR1, a close related ITIM-receptor, are expressed by AML stem cells (AML-SCs) and support AML development (Zheng et al , 2012; Kang et al , in press). Although counterintuitive, this result is consistent with the generally immune-suppressive and thus tumor-promoting roles of the inhibitory receptors in the immune system (Ma et al, 2011).
In recent work, the inventors found that several members of the LILRB family are highly expressed on AML cells, and their expression negatively correlates with the overall survival of human AML patients. LILRBs are expressed by both AML-SCs and some differentiated acute leukemia cells (including AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL). There is no defect in the normal hematopoietic development in mice that do not express any individual LILRB tested. Interestingly, however, knockout of individual LILRBs reversed leukemia development in a number of AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) mouse models and abolished AML-SCs (Zheng et al , 2012; Kang et al , in press; also see PCT/US 13/43431). In addition, inhibition of expression of several LILRBs individually in different human leukemia cell lines in culture and blocked leukemia development in xenografted mice (Kang et al , in press; also see PCT/US 13/43431).
The inventors have determined that some leukemia stem cells express high levels of ITIM-inhibitory receptors including LILRBs. The current treatment options for patients with acute leukemia, including chemotherapy, do not efficiently target cancer stem cells because these inhibitory receptors enable the leukemia stem cells to survive the conventional therapies eventually resulting in tumor relapse. The inventors theorize that LILRB signaling represents an ideal target for treating AML for several reasons: 1) several LILRBs are essential to the survival of AML cells including AML-SCs; 2) knockout of an individual LILRB does not result in overt defects in normal hematopoiesis; and 3) inhibition of LILRB activity stimulates immunity and indirectly boosts anti-tumor effects.', NULL, CAST(N'2017-07-20T14:39:59.413' AS DateTime), 1562, N'WO2016144728', 1, N'ANTI-LILRB ANTIBODIES AND THEIR USE IN DETECTING AND TREATING CANCER', NULL, 3155, CAST(N'2019-04-30' AS Date))

The system may provide a UV source that is utilized to excite a sample, and a line-scan camera may capture imaging of fluorescent emission cause by the excitation. In some embodiments, the tissue sample may be stained with fluorescent markers. In some cases, fluorescently-tagged antibodies or other agents may be covalently linked to the tissue using a linker, such as glutaraldehyde. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to embed the tissue in an imaging or supporting matrix prior to imaging. As a nonlimiting example, the sample may be dehydrated and infused with paraffin wax, and embedded in a paraffin cylinder or block. Further, in another nonlimting example, the tissue may be optically cleared and embedded into an optical transparent matrix such as a hydrogel. The tissue sample embedded in the imaging or supporting matrix may be place on a rotating mechanism that rotates at a constant rate, while the UV source excites a desired region and the camera captures images. The system may also provide a lathe mechanism, such as a microtome blade, to ablate surface of the sample block during rotation to allow further imaging of underlying layers. Once the sample has been fully imaged after several turns, 3D imaging of the entire tissue sample may be provided.
[0008]  In some embodiments, SALT imaging may be performed to image an entire organ or tissue sample. Fluorescently-tagged antibodies or other agents may be covalently linked to the organ or tissue sample using a linker, such as glutaraldehyde. Further, the sample may be dehydrated and infused with paraffin wax, and embedded in a paraffin cylinder or block.  In some embodiments, the tissue may be optically cleared and embedded into an optical transparent matrix such as a hydrogel. The tissue sample embedded in the imaging or supporting matrix may then be place on a rotating mechanism that rotates at a constant rate, while the UV source excites a desired region and the camera captures images. After one full 360° turn, the camera captures a shell of the outer layer of the organ or tissue. While the cylinder is being rotated, a lathe mechanism may remove a thin outer layer of wax and tissue that has been imaged, which removes the imaged shell so that subsequent underlying layers can be imaged as well. When cylinder has made sufficient turns to gather a complete set of shells, the shells may be merged together to provide a 3D image or map of the organ or tissue sample.

The present disclosure relates generally to the fields of medicine, oncology, and immunology. More particular, the disclosure relates to antibodies that LILRBs and can treat cancers, including leukemias.

Background

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia of adults. Despite continuous treatment, most patients relapse within 5 years. To effectively treat acute leukemia, new molecular targets and therapeutic approaches must be identified. Recently, the inventors cloned the human leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2 (LILRB2) as a receptor for several angiopoietin-like proteins (Angptls) (Zheng et al, 2012). The LILRB family receptors are type I transmembrane glycoprotein containing extracellular Ig-like domains that bind ligands and intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and are classified as inhibitory receptors because ITIM motifs can recruit phosphatases SHP-1, SHP-2, or SHIP to negatively regulate immune cell activation (Takai et al , 2011; Daeron et al, 2008; Katz et al, 2006). It is known that LILRBs are expressed on myeloid cells and certain other hematopoietic cells (Mori et al, 2008). Surprisingly, the inventors have shown that PirB, the mouse ortholog of LILRB2, and LAIR1, a close related ITIM-receptor, are expressed by AML stem cells (AML-SCs) and support AML development (Zheng et al , 2012; Kang et al , in press). Although counterintuitive, this result is consistent with the generally immune-suppressive and thus tumor-promoting roles of the inhibitory receptors in the immune system (Ma et al, 2011).
In recent work, the inventors found that several members of the LILRB family are highly expressed on AML cells, and their expression negatively correlates with the overall survival of human AML patients. LILRBs are expressed by both AML-SCs and some differentiated acute leukemia cells (including AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL). There is no defect in the normal hematopoietic development in mice that do not express any individual LILRB tested. Interestingly, however, knockout of individual LILRBs reversed leukemia development in a number of AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) mouse models and abolished AML-SCs (Zheng et al , 2012; Kang et al , in press; also see PCT/US 13/43431). In addition, inhibition of expression of several LILRBs individually in different human leukemia cell lines in culture and blocked leukemia development in xenografted mice (Kang et al , in press; also see PCT/US 13/43431).
The inventors have determined that some leukemia stem cells express high levels of ITIM-inhibitory receptors including LILRBs. The current treatment options for patients with acute leukemia, including chemotherapy, do not efficiently target cancer stem cells because these inhibitory receptors enable the leukemia stem cells to survive the conventional therapies eventually resulting in tumor relapse. The inventors theorize that LILRB signaling represents an ideal target for treating AML for several reasons: 1) several LILRBs are essential to the survival of AML cells including AML-SCs; 2) knockout of an individual LILRB does not result in overt defects in normal hematopoiesis; and 3) inhibition of LILRB activity stimulates immunity and indirectly boosts anti-tumor effects.', NULL, CAST(N'2017-07-20T14:39:59.413' AS DateTime), 1562, N'WO2016144728', 1, N'ANTI-LILRB ANTIBODIES AND THEIR USE IN DETECTING AND TREATING CANCER', 1, 5418, CAST(N'2019-04-30' AS Date))

Its unrivaled sensitivity and signal to noise ratio have enabled the observation of endocytois, exocytosis, trafficking and virus dynamics. TIRF is based on total internal reflection and the resulting evanescent field that is generated at a refractive index interface (here glass to water). The evanescent field only penetrates around 100nm into the sample, creating a very thin illuminated optical section. In practice, the evanescent field is however scattered by the sample, resulting in out-of-focus blur and increased background. By design of a TIRF microscope, there is no mechanism to reject such blur, as all fluorescence light emitted by the microscope is captured. The invention here presents a method to reject out of focus blur in TIRF microscopy, thereby greatly increasing the clarity and signal to noise ratio in the final image. It is expected that this invention will greatly aid researchers to image weakly fluorescent objects and aid image analysis.', NULL, CAST(N'2017-07-14T10:20:53.440' AS DateTime), NULL, N'62/434,922', 2, N'Total Internal Reflection and Transmission Illumination Fluorescence Microscopy Imaging System with Improved Background Suppression', 1, 5434, CAST(N'2019-04-30' AS Date))

In some embodiments, the tissue sample may be stained with fluorescent markers. In some cases, fluorescently-tagged antibodies or other agents may be covalently linked to the tissue using a linker, such as glutaraldehyde. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to embed the tissue in an imaging or supporting matrix prior to imaging. As a nonlimiting example, the sample may be dehydrated and infused with paraffin wax, and embedded in a paraffin cylinder or block. Further, in another nonlimting example, the tissue may be optically cleared and embedded into an optical transparent matrix such as a hydrogel. The tissue sample embedded in the imaging or supporting matrix may be place on a rotating mechanism that rotates at a constant rate, while the UV source excites a desired region and the camera captures images. The system may also provide a lathe mechanism, such as a microtome blade, to ablate surface of the sample block during rotation to allow further imaging of underlying layers. Once the sample has been fully imaged after several turns, 3D imaging of the entire tissue sample may be provided.
[0008]  In some embodiments, SALT imaging may be performed to image an entire organ or tissue sample. Fluorescently-tagged antibodies or other agents may be covalently linked to the organ or tissue sample using a linker, such as glutaraldehyde. Further, the sample may be dehydrated and infused with paraffin wax, and embedded in a paraffin cylinder or block.  In some embodiments, the tissue may be optically cleared and embedded into an optical transparent matrix such as a hydrogel. The tissue sample embedded in the imaging or supporting matrix may then be place on a rotating mechanism that rotates at a constant rate, while the UV source excites a desired region and the camera captures images. After one full 360° turn, the camera captures a shell of the outer layer of the organ or tissue. While the cylinder is being rotated, a lathe mechanism may remove a thin outer layer of wax and tissue that has been imaged, which removes the imaged shell so that subsequent underlying layers can be imaged as well. When cylinder has made sufficient turns to gather a complete set of shells, the shells may be merged together to provide a 3D image or map of the organ or tissue sample.

S1) onto pH insensitive near infrared emitting glutathione coated AuNPs (GS-AuNPs) (FIG. 1A).  When the pH increased from 6 to 10, the emission intensity of TAMRA increased over five-fold, while the emission intensity of GS-AuNPs only changed less than 10%. Thus, the emission ratio of TAMRA to GS-AuNP was found to linearly depend on the pH of local environment. Photophysical spectroscopic studies show that this pH dependent emission of TAMRA originates from its dimerization on the AuNPs, of which the geometry was highly sensitive to the protonation of glutathione on AuNPs. Not limited to pH insensitive dyes, a well-known pH sensitive dye, fluorescein, became even more sensitive to pH changes within a larger pH range after being conjugated to GS-AuNPs. These results clearly indicate that this unique synergy arising from conjugation of organic dyes onto luminescent AuNPs offers a new pathway to design ultrasmall ratiometric pH-responsive nanoindicators.

This is a particularly troublesome feature of nucleic acid (NA) delivery where hydrolytic enzymes threaten the integrity of the therapeutic NA molecules during transport to their intended target.  In addition, the tumor selective delivery of NA is easily accomplished by the NA containing rHDL nanoparticles as their payload is discharged primarily via the SR-B1 receptor which is overexpressed by malignant cells and tissues.

A patent, held jointly by MD Anderson Cancer Center and UNTHSC, titled “HDL particles for delivery of nucleic acids” (US8734853) issued in 2014.  However, several technical concerns remained, including homogeneity stability and the storage conditions for the long-term shelf life of the siRNA/rHDL nanoparticles.

We were recently able to address these concerns and now have an enhanced siRNA/rHDL formulation in hand (see below).

Because Dr. Mooberry will present this information at the annual meeting of the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in April, the principals of Fannin Innovation Studio (the firm currently engaged in marketing the rHDL nucleic acid delivery technology) suggested that an extension be filed to the original patent (US8734853) to protect the new intellectual property associated with this project.', NULL, CAST(N'2018-01-08T10:24:43.357' AS DateTime), NULL, N'Serial No. 62/488,223', 2, N'ENHANCED NUCLEIC ACID DELIVERY VIA HDL or RECONSTITUTED HDL NANOPARTICLES', NULL, 5052, CAST(N'2019-04-30' AS Date))

Patients who receive this type of chemotherapy regimen not only suffer from side effects during the treatment period but often have serious complications (especially cardiac damage) several years subsequent to the completion of the cancer therapy.

The novelty in this project lies in the combination of the Trojan horse features of rHDL-drug nanoparticles with the capability of delivering anti-cancer agents selectively to cancer cells and tumors.

Since its description in C. elegans and mammalian cells, use of siRNA as a method of gene silencing has rapidly become a powerful tool in protein function delineation, gene discovery, and drug development. The promise of specific RNA degradation has also generated much excitement for possible use as a therapeutic modality, but in vivo siRNA delivery has proven difficult. Delivery methods that are effective for other nucleic acids are not necessarily effective for siRNA.  Therefore, most studies using siRNA in vivo involve manipulation of gene expression in a cell line prior to introduction into an animal model, or incorporation of siRNA into a viral vector.  Delivery of “naked” siRNA in vivo has been restricted to site-specific injections or through high-pressure means that are not clinically practical.  One study that showed in vivo uptake and targeted downregulation of an endogenous protein by an siRNA after normal systemic dosing required chemical modification of the siRNA; however, this chemical modification has an unknown toxicity and may result in significant toxicity to a subject in vivo.  Further this chemical modification may affect siRNA activity and/or longevity. Cationic liposomes have been used to deliver siRNA to various cell types.

A major cause of this detrimental effect is due to cancer-induced expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which are the most powerful suppressors of T cell function.  Neutralizing this bad function of MDSCs should improve the host immune response against cancer.
We have shown that DC-HIL is the critical mediator of the T cell-suppressive function of MDSCs in mouse and human melanoma models.  DC-HIL is expressed on the surface of activated and immunosuppressive MDSCs in melanoma patients, but not in “naive” MDSCs in healthy controls, making DC-HIL expression a marker for activation of immunosuppressive MDSCs. The level of DC-HIL expression on blood-circulating MDSCs correlates positively with the clinical cancer stage of melanoma (as well as cancers of the colon, breast and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma).  Binding of DC-HIL to its ligand syndecan-4 on effector T cells triggers a unique intracellular signal pathway within MDSCs.  Most importantly, our anti-DC-HIL monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reverses the T cell-suppressive function of MDSCs from melanoma patients, thereby restoring the anti-cancer immune responses of these T cells.
The usefulness of our invention lies in the ability of our antibodies (mouse anti-human DC-HIL mAbs) to neutralize the T cell-suppressive function of MDSCs from patients with melanoma and other cancers.
The complementary determining regions (CDRs) of our mAb can be used to create humanized Abs with conserved anti-MDSC function.

This is a particularly troublesome feature of nucleic acid (NA) delivery where hydrolytic enzymes threaten the integrity of the therapeutic NA molecules during transport to their intended target.  In addition, the tumor selective delivery of NA is easily accomplished by the NA containing rHDL nanoparticles as their payload is discharged primarily via the SR-B1 receptor which is overexpressed by malignant cells and tissues.

A patent, held jointly by MD Anderson Cancer Center and UNTHSC, titled “HDL particles for delivery of nucleic acids” (US8734853) issued in 2014.  However, several technical concerns remained, including homogeneity stability and the storage conditions for the long-term shelf life of the siRNA/rHDL nanoparticles.

We were recently able to address these concerns and now have an enhanced siRNA/rHDL formulation in hand (see below).

Because Dr. Mooberry will present this information at the annual meeting of the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in April, the principals of Fannin Innovation Studio (the firm currently engaged in marketing the rHDL nucleic acid delivery technology) suggested that an extension be filed to the original patent (US8734853) to protect the new intellectual property associated with this project.', NULL, CAST(N'2018-01-08T10:24:43.357' AS DateTime), NULL, N'Serial No. 62/488,223', 2, N'ENHANCED NUCLEIC ACID DELIVERY VIA HDL or RECONSTITUTED HDL NANOPARTICLES', 1, 5889, CAST(N'2019-04-30' AS Date))

A major cause of this detrimental effect is due to cancer-induced expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which are the most powerful suppressors of T cell function.  Neutralizing this bad function of MDSCs should improve the host immune response against cancer.
We have shown that DC-HIL is the critical mediator of the T cell-suppressive function of MDSCs in mouse and human melanoma models.  DC-HIL is expressed on the surface of activated and immunosuppressive MDSCs in melanoma patients, but not in “naive” MDSCs in healthy controls, making DC-HIL expression a marker for activation of immunosuppressive MDSCs. The level of DC-HIL expression on blood-circulating MDSCs correlates positively with the clinical cancer stage of melanoma (as well as cancers of the colon, breast and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma).  Binding of DC-HIL to its ligand syndecan-4 on effector T cells triggers a unique intracellular signal pathway within MDSCs.  Most importantly, our anti-DC-HIL monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reverses the T cell-suppressive function of MDSCs from melanoma patients, thereby restoring the anti-cancer immune responses of these T cells.
The usefulness of our invention lies in the ability of our antibodies (mouse anti-human DC-HIL mAbs) to neutralize the T cell-suppressive function of MDSCs from patients with melanoma and other cancers.
The complementary determining regions (CDRs) of our mAb can be used to create humanized Abs with conserved anti-MDSC function.  These humanized Abs can then be used to treat patients with melanoma or other cancers.', NULL, CAST(N'2018-02-07T11:36:48.740' AS DateTime), NULL, N'US 62/131,473', 2, N'Anti-DC-HIL antibodies for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy', 1, 5941, CAST(N'2019-04-30' AS Date))

Exosomes in the tumor microenvironment may play a key role in facilitating of cell-cell communication. Exosomes are reported to predominantly contain RNA and proteins. In this study, we investigated whether exosomes from pancreatic cancer cells and serum of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma contain genomic DNA. Our results provide evidence that exosomes contain long fragments of double-stranded genomic DNA. Mutations in KRAS and p53 can be detected using genomic DNA from exosomes derived from pancreatic cancer cell lines and serum of patients with pancreatic cancer.

Therefore, PDAC is in urgent need of effective new therapies. Genetic analyses of PDAC show that mutations in RAS family of small GTPases (KrasG12/D/R/V) are encountered in 70% and up to 96% of patients and are key drivers of tumor growth and metastasis. Genetic manipulations in mice have shown that dampening oncogenic KRAS reverses tumor progression. Oncogenic KRAS signaling and increased RAS activity have emerged as initiating driver of pancreas neoplasia, however RAS remains an intractable target and a therapy challenge. Here, exosomes derived from normal fibroblasts were engineered to carry RNA interference (RNAi) payloads to target oncogenic KRASG12D. Exosomes containing siRNA or shRNA against KrasG12D  efficiently entered cancer cells and specifically suppressed oncogenic Ras, attenuating ERK activation, inhibiting proliferation and inducing cancer cell apoptosis. Liposomes were not as affecting highlighting the systemic delivery challenges associated with RNA interference constructs. Systemic delivery of exosomes with KrasG12D targeting cargo show robust pancreas localization and suppression of pre-established orthotopic human pancreas tumors as well as tumors in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of pancreas cancer, together with an improvement in survival, when compared to liposomes containing si/sh RNA and exosomes with scrambled RNAi constructs. We show that one reason why liposomes do not work as efficiently to deliver RNAi constructs is because they recruit more monocytes and get phagocytosed via toll like receptors. Tumors of mice treated with si/sh RNA containing exosomes displayed significant decrease in downstream RAS signal mediators and improved histopathological findings with normal pancreas histology. Collectively, this report offers new possibilities for direct, specific and efficient targeting of oncogenic RAS in pancreas cancer using engineered exosomes.

The presence of many components of the mRNA translation machinery in exosomes from normal and cancer cells, such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), free amino acids and eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), prompted us to evaluate their intrinsic capacity to produce functional proteins in cell-free conditions. Exosomes incubated with 35S-methionine produce several labeled proteins, which are sensitive to cycloheximide inhibition. The presence of RNA polymerase II prompted us to evaluate DNA transcription as well as translation. Exosomes were directly electroporated with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) expression plasmid and GFP protein was detected in the exosomes by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. GFP protein production was inhibited by -amanitin or cyclohexamide. Using a bicistronic reporter construct we demonstrate exosome translation is cap-dependent. Exosomes derived from MDA-MB231 cells, which lack wild type p53 protein, electroporated with a wild type p53-GFP fusion plasmid, led to reactivation of p21 when delivered to naïve MDA-MB231 cells. This suggests that proteins produced in exosomes are biologically active. Collectively, this report provides unprecedented evidence for cell-independent DNA transcription and mRNA translation in exosomes. While the implications of this need further unraveling, these observations suggest a functional role for exosomes in facilitating cell-cell communication via de novo synthesis and delivery of proteins.

been replaced with uncharged N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine units. Like DNA and RNA, PNA obeys
WC base pairing rules, forming stable antiparallel duplexes with DNA. In contrast to the native
polymers, however, PNA has no inherent chirality, and as a result, hybridizes to DNA or RNA
irrespective of chirality. On the basis of this property, we conceived two novel toeholdmediated
strand-displacement reactions (hereinafter referred to as simply stranddisplacement
reactions) that exploit DNA/PNA heteroduplexes in order to interface the two
enantiomers of DNA (Fig. 1b and 1c). In Reaction A, a DNA/PNA substrate complex (S1) is
activated via binding of a DNA input (IN0) to its DNA toehold domain (t*), resulting in
displacement of the achiral PNA strand. In this reaction, the chirality of input signal must match
the chirality of the incumbent DNA strand on the DNA/PNA heteroduplex. Release of the PNAstrand effectively decouples the stereochemical information from the sequence information
present in the chiral input. At this point, the achiral PNA output can serve as a sequencespecific
input for downstream reactions with either D-DNA or L-DNA components. In
Reaction B (Fig. 1c), the toehold domain (t*) resides on the achiral PNA strand in the initial
DNA/PNA substrate complex (S2). Therefore, S2 can be activated by either D-DNA or L-DNA
inputs (D-IN0 or L-IN0, respectively) to directly generate an output having a single,
predetermined chirality.', NULL, CAST(N'2018-07-22T13:01:52.930' AS DateTime), NULL, N'Not yet known', 2, N'HETEROCHIRAL NUCLEIC ACID STRAND-DISPLACEMENT REACTIONS AND SYSTEMS', NULL, 5431, CAST(N'2019-04-30' AS Date))

Current methods for BBB opening including osmotic shock, focus ultrasound disruption and vasoactive agents just yield modest outcomes in clinical applications due to safety and toxicity. Here we report a novel method to optically open the BBB, namely plasmonic nanobubble-induced BBB transient opening. The generation of plasmonic nanobubble around overheated plasmonic nanoparticles produces mechanical force leading to BBB transiently opening to allow macromolecules across it. We tested the plasmonic nanobubble BBB opening in vitro and in vivo.
Using human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell D3 as in vitro BBB model, we show that plasmonic gold nanoparticles functionalized with antibodies co-localize with the tight junction proteins of the membrane. Using laser irradiation to generate nanobubbles, the trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) value dropped by 50% and the permeability of 40 kDa dextran increased by 23-fold. Moreover, the TEER recovers 6 hours after applying the laser, which indicates a reversible disruption of BBB in vitro. We further demonstrate in vivo BBB opening by visualizing extravasation of Evan’s blue dye, which binds to albumin in the blood circulation and thus otherwise doesn’t accumulate in the brain with intact BBB. Neuropathology staining shows that the cerebral blood vessels and astrocytes were intact with BBB opening. Our findings suggest that plasmonic nanobubbles can effectively disrupt the tight junctions and transiently open the BBB, which can be an informative platform for brain drug delivery. Advantages of this innovative approach is the unprecedented optical resolution for BBB opening, compared with previous approaches using osmotic shock or ultrasound.', NULL, CAST(N'2018-07-25T22:18:11.690' AS DateTime), NULL, N'62/685,910', 2, N'Method for Optical Opening of the Blood-Brain Barrier', NULL, 5444, CAST(N'2019-04-30' AS Date))

However, additional predictive markers are required for successful administration of these inhibitors, as they only work in as yet incompletely defined subsets of tumors(22),(23). Impact of MutL defects on CDK4/6 addiction has not been reported, but a role for MutL-loss in predicting response to CDK4/6 inhibitors is plausible based on our finding that MutL-loss is a predictor of response to CDK4/6 inhibitors in ER+ breast cancer in vitro, in vivo and in patient tumors. Proof-of-principle experiments indicate that intrinsically MutL- CRC line, HT-115 and bladder cancer cell line, RT4, are more susceptible to CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, than MutL+ cells (Fig 2). Moreover, knocking down MLH1 with pooled siRNA in MutL+ bladder cancer cell line, J-82 induces sensitivity to abemaciclib (Fig 2b). TCGA RPPA data confirms significant upregulation of CCND1/D3, CDK4 partners, in ER+ breast, bladder and colorectal MutL- vs MutL+ tumors (p<0.001; FDR<0.01), indicating relevance to human tumors.These data indicate a role for the four principal MutL genes: MLH1, MLH3, PMS1 and PMS2, in predicting resistance to standard-of-care, and most importantly, sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. We propose that diagnostic tests for this combination of genes can be used to identify patients most likely to be resistant to standard-of-care and likely to respond well to CDK4/6 inhibitors.', NULL, CAST(N'2018-07-26T09:37:33.957' AS DateTime), 1383, N'62/670,368', 2, N'MutL LOSS PREDICTS SENSITIVITY TO CDK4/6 INHIBITORS IN CANCER', NULL, 5585, CAST(N'2019-04-30' AS Date))

Current methods for BBB opening including osmotic shock, focus ultrasound disruption and vasoactive agents just yield modest outcomes in clinical applications due to safety and toxicity. Here we report a novel method to optically open the BBB, namely plasmonic nanobubble-induced BBB transient opening. The generation of plasmonic nanobubble around overheated plasmonic nanoparticles produces mechanical force leading to BBB transiently opening to allow macromolecules across it. We tested the plasmonic nanobubble BBB opening in vitro and in vivo.
Using human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell D3 as in vitro BBB model, we show that plasmonic gold nanoparticles functionalized with antibodies co-localize with the tight junction proteins of the membrane. Using laser irradiation to generate nanobubbles, the trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) value dropped by 50% and the permeability of 40 kDa dextran increased by 23-fold. Moreover, the TEER recovers 6 hours after applying the laser, which indicates a reversible disruption of BBB in vitro. We further demonstrate in vivo BBB opening by visualizing extravasation of Evan’s blue dye, which binds to albumin in the blood circulation and thus otherwise doesn’t accumulate in the brain with intact BBB. Neuropathology staining shows that the cerebral blood vessels and astrocytes were intact with BBB opening. Our findings suggest that plasmonic nanobubbles can effectively disrupt the tight junctions and transiently open the BBB, which can be an informative platform for brain drug delivery.

The present disclosure relates generally to the fields of medicine, oncology, and immunology. More particular, the disclosure relates to antibodies that LILRBs and can treat cancers, including leukemias.

Background

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia of adults. Despite continuous treatment, most patients relapse within 5 years. To effectively treat acute leukemia, new molecular targets and therapeutic approaches must be identified. Recently, the inventors cloned the human leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2 (LILRB2) as a receptor for several angiopoietin-like proteins (Angptls) (Zheng et al, 2012). The LILRB family receptors are type I transmembrane glycoprotein containing extracellular Ig-like domains that bind ligands and intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and are classified as inhibitory receptors because ITIM motifs can recruit phosphatases SHP-1, SHP-2, or SHIP to negatively regulate immune cell activation (Takai et al , 2011; Daeron et al, 2008; Katz et al, 2006). It is known that LILRBs are expressed on myeloid cells and certain other hematopoietic cells (Mori et al, 2008). Surprisingly, the inventors have shown that PirB, the mouse ortholog of LILRB2, and LAIR1, a close related ITIM-receptor, are expressed by AML stem cells (AML-SCs) and support AML development (Zheng et al , 2012; Kang et al , in press). Although counterintuitive, this result is consistent with the generally immune-suppressive and thus tumor-promoting roles of the inhibitory receptors in the immune system (Ma et al, 2011).
In recent work, the inventors found that several members of the LILRB family are highly expressed on AML cells, and their expression negatively correlates with the overall survival of human AML patients. LILRBs are expressed by both AML-SCs and some differentiated acute leukemia cells (including AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL). There is no defect in the normal hematopoietic development in mice that do not express any individual LILRB tested. Interestingly, however, knockout of individual LILRBs reversed leukemia development in a number of AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) mouse models and abolished AML-SCs (Zheng et al , 2012; Kang et al , in press; also see PCT/US 13/43431). In addition, inhibition of expression of several LILRBs individually in different human leukemia cell lines in culture and blocked leukemia development in xenografted mice (Kang et al , in press; also see PCT/US 13/43431).
The inventors have determined that some leukemia stem cells express high levels of ITIM-inhibitory receptors including LILRBs. The current treatment options for patients with acute leukemia, including chemotherapy, do not efficiently target cancer stem cells because these inhibitory receptors enable the leukemia stem cells to survive the conventional therapies eventually resulting in tumor relapse. The inventors theorize that LILRB signaling represents an ideal target for treating AML for several reasons: 1) several LILRBs are essential to the survival of AML cells including AML-SCs; 2) knockout of an individual LILRB does not result in overt defects in normal hematopoiesis; and 3) inhibition of LILRB activity stimulates immunity and indirectly boosts anti-tumor effects.', NULL, CAST(N'2017-07-20T14:39:59.413' AS DateTime), 1562, N'WO2016144728', 1, N'ANTI-LILRB ANTIBODIES AND THEIR USE IN DETECTING AND TREATING CANCER', 1, 6295, CAST(N'2020-02-29' AS Date))

been replaced with uncharged N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine units. Like DNA and RNA, PNA obeys
WC base pairing rules, forming stable antiparallel duplexes with DNA. In contrast to the native
polymers, however, PNA has no inherent chirality, and as a result, hybridizes to DNA or RNA
irrespective of chirality. On the basis of this property, we conceived two novel toeholdmediated
strand-displacement reactions (hereinafter referred to as simply stranddisplacement
reactions) that exploit DNA/PNA heteroduplexes in order to interface the two
enantiomers of DNA (Fig. 1b and 1c). In Reaction A, a DNA/PNA substrate complex (S1) is
activated via binding of a DNA input (IN0) to its DNA toehold domain (t*), resulting in
displacement of the achiral PNA strand. In this reaction, the chirality of input signal must match
the chirality of the incumbent DNA strand on the DNA/PNA heteroduplex. Release of the PNAstrand effectively decouples the stereochemical information from the sequence information
present in the chiral input. At this point, the achiral PNA output can serve as a sequencespecific
input for downstream reactions with either D-DNA or L-DNA components. In
Reaction B (Fig. 1c), the toehold domain (t*) resides on the achiral PNA strand in the initial
DNA/PNA substrate complex (S2). Therefore, S2 can be activated by either D-DNA or L-DNA
inputs (D-IN0 or L-IN0, respectively) to directly generate an output having a single,
predetermined chirality.', NULL, CAST(N'2019-07-30T13:22:45.480' AS DateTime), 1711, N'62/626,124', 2, N'HETEROCHIRAL NUCLEIC ACID STRAND-DISPLACEMENT REACTIONS AND SYSTEMS', 1, 6306, CAST(N'2020-02-29' AS Date))

However, additional predictive markers are required for successful administration of these inhibitors, as they only work in as yet incompletely defined subsets of tumors(22),(23). Impact of MutL defects on CDK4/6 addiction has not been reported, but a role for MutL-loss in predicting response to CDK4/6 inhibitors is plausible based on our finding that MutL-loss is a predictor of response to CDK4/6 inhibitors in ER+ breast cancer in vitro, in vivo and in patient tumors. Proof-of-principle experiments indicate that intrinsically MutL- CRC line, HT-115 and bladder cancer cell line, RT4, are more susceptible to CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, than MutL+ cells (Fig 2). Moreover, knocking down MLH1 with pooled siRNA in MutL+ bladder cancer cell line, J-82 induces sensitivity to abemaciclib (Fig 2b). TCGA RPPA data confirms significant upregulation of CCND1/D3, CDK4 partners, in ER+ breast, bladder and colorectal MutL- vs MutL+ tumors (p<0.001; FDR<0.01), indicating relevance to human tumors.These data indicate a role for the four principal MutL genes: MLH1, MLH3, PMS1 and PMS2, in predicting resistance to standard-of-care, and most importantly, sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.

Its unrivaled sensitivity and signal to noise ratio have enabled the observation of endocytois, exocytosis, trafficking and virus dynamics. TIRF is based on total internal reflection and the resulting evanescent field that is generated at a refractive index interface (here glass to water). The evanescent field only penetrates around 100nm into the sample, creating a very thin illuminated optical section. In practice, the evanescent field is however scattered by the sample, resulting in out-of-focus blur and increased background. By design of a TIRF microscope, there is no mechanism to reject such blur, as all fluorescence light emitted by the microscope is captured. The invention here presents a method to reject out of focus blur in TIRF microscopy, thereby greatly increasing the clarity and signal to noise ratio in the final image. It is expected that this invention will greatly aid researchers to image weakly fluorescent objects and aid image analysis.', NULL, CAST(N'2017-07-14T10:20:53.440' AS DateTime), NULL, N'62/434,922', 2, N'Total Internal Reflection and Transmission Illumination Fluorescence Microscopy Imaging System with Improved Background Suppression', 1, 6318, CAST(N'2020-02-29' AS Date))

The system may provide a UV source that is utilized to excite a sample, and a line-scan camera may capture imaging of fluorescent emission cause by the excitation. In some embodiments, the tissue sample may be stained with fluorescent markers. In some cases, fluorescently-tagged antibodies or other agents may be covalently linked to the tissue using a linker, such as glutaraldehyde. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to embed the tissue in an imaging or supporting matrix prior to imaging. As a nonlimiting example, the sample may be dehydrated and infused with paraffin wax, and embedded in a paraffin cylinder or block. Further, in another nonlimting example, the tissue may be optically cleared and embedded into an optical transparent matrix such as a hydrogel. The tissue sample embedded in the imaging or supporting matrix may be place on a rotating mechanism that rotates at a constant rate, while the UV source excites a desired region and the camera captures images. The system may also provide a lathe mechanism, such as a microtome blade, to ablate surface of the sample block during rotation to allow further imaging of underlying layers. Once the sample has been fully imaged after several turns, 3D imaging of the entire tissue sample may be provided.
[0008]  In some embodiments, SALT imaging may be performed to image an entire organ or tissue sample. Fluorescently-tagged antibodies or other agents may be covalently linked to the organ or tissue sample using a linker, such as glutaraldehyde. Further, the sample may be dehydrated and infused with paraffin wax, and embedded in a paraffin cylinder or block.  In some embodiments, the tissue may be optically cleared and embedded into an optical transparent matrix such as a hydrogel. The tissue sample embedded in the imaging or supporting matrix may then be place on a rotating mechanism that rotates at a constant rate, while the UV source excites a desired region and the camera captures images. After one full 360° turn, the camera captures a shell of the outer layer of the organ or tissue. While the cylinder is being rotated, a lathe mechanism may remove a thin outer layer of wax and tissue that has been imaged, which removes the imaged shell so that subsequent underlying layers can be imaged as well. When cylinder has made sufficient turns to gather a complete set of shells, the shells may be merged together to provide a 3D image or map of the organ or tissue sample.

The promise of specific RNA degradation has also generated much excitement for possible use as a therapeutic modality, but in vivo siRNA delivery has proven difficult. Delivery methods that are effective for other nucleic acids are not necessarily effective for siRNA.  Therefore, most studies using siRNA in vivo involve manipulation of gene expression in a cell line prior to introduction into an animal model, or incorporation of siRNA into a viral vector.  Delivery of “naked” siRNA in vivo has been restricted to site-specific injections or through high-pressure means that are not clinically practical.  One study that showed in vivo uptake and targeted downregulation of an endogenous protein by an siRNA after normal systemic dosing required chemical modification of the siRNA; however, this chemical modification has an unknown toxicity and may result in significant toxicity to a subject in vivo.  Further this chemical modification may affect siRNA activity and/or longevity. Cationic liposomes have been used to deliver siRNA to various cell types.

Fluorescently-tagged antibodies or other agents may be covalently linked to the organ or tissue sample using a linker, such as glutaraldehyde. Further, the sample may be dehydrated and infused with paraffin wax, and embedded in a paraffin cylinder or block.  In some embodiments, the tissue may be optically cleared and embedded into an optical transparent matrix such as a hydrogel.

When cylinder has made sufficient turns to gather a complete set of shells, the shells may be merged together to provide a 3D image or map of the organ or tissue sample.

However, leaky blood vessels enable tumor cells to be exposed to cell-free heme in the blood. Consequently, tumor cells internalize heme to promote ATP generation via OXPHOS. Bacterial hemophores, HasAs, are secreted by bacteria to scavenge heme from the host. Thus, unlike heme-binding proteins in the blood, HasAs are not internalized by mammalian host cells. Thus, such hemophores have the capability to sequester heme and prevent heme from being used by tumor cells. We generated various mutant forms of Yersinia pestis hemophore (HasA). These heme-sequestering peptides inhibit heme uptake, decrease mitochondrial heme levels in NSCLC cells, and suppress tumor growth in mice.

TIRF is based on total internal reflection and the resulting evanescent field that is generated at a refractive index interface (here glass to water). The evanescent field only penetrates around 100nm into the sample, creating a very thin illuminated optical section. In practice, the evanescent field is however scattered by the sample, resulting in out-of-focus blur and increased background. By design of a TIRF microscope, there is no mechanism to reject such blur, as all fluorescence light emitted by the microscope is captured.

They are complementary and there is no one size fits it all. We discovered a new mathematical theory that describes how all aforementioned light-sheets can be synthesized.

been replaced with uncharged N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine units. Like DNA and RNA, PNA obeys
WC base pairing rules, forming stable antiparallel duplexes with DNA. In contrast to the native
polymers, however, PNA has no inherent chirality, and as a result, hybridizes to DNA or RNA
irrespective of chirality. On the basis of this property, we conceived two novel toeholdmediated
strand-displacement reactions (hereinafter referred to as simply stranddisplacement
reactions) that exploit DNA/PNA heteroduplexes in order to interface the two
enantiomers of DNA (Fig. 1b and 1c). In Reaction A, a DNA/PNA substrate complex (S1) is
activated via binding of a DNA input (IN0) to its DNA toehold domain (t*), resulting in
displacement of the achiral PNA strand. In this reaction, the chirality of input signal must match
the chirality of the incumbent DNA strand on the DNA/PNA heteroduplex. Release of the PNAstrand effectively decouples the stereochemical information from the sequence information
present in the chiral input. At this point, the achiral PNA output can serve as a sequencespecific
input for downstream reactions with either D-DNA or L-DNA components. In
Reaction B (Fig. 1c), the toehold domain (t*) resides on the achiral PNA strand in the initial
DNA/PNA substrate complex (S2). Therefore, S2 can be activated by either D-DNA or L-DNA
inputs (D-IN0 or L-IN0, respectively) to directly generate an output having a single,
predetermined chirality.', NULL, CAST(N'2019-07-30T13:22:45.480' AS DateTime), 1711, N'62/626,124', 2, N'HETEROCHIRAL NUCLEIC ACID STRAND-DISPLACEMENT REACTIONS AND SYSTEMS', 1, 7110, CAST(N'2020-05-31' AS Date))

However, additional predictive markers are required for successful administration of these inhibitors, as they only work in as yet incompletely defined subsets of tumors(22),(23). Impact of MutL defects on CDK4/6 addiction has not been reported, but a role for MutL-loss in predicting response to CDK4/6 inhibitors is plausible based on our finding that MutL-loss is a predictor of response to CDK4/6 inhibitors in ER+ breast cancer in vitro, in vivo and in patient tumors. Proof-of-principle experiments indicate that intrinsically MutL- CRC line, HT-115 and bladder cancer cell line, RT4, are more susceptible to CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, than MutL+ cells (Fig 2). Moreover, knocking down MLH1 with pooled siRNA in MutL+ bladder cancer cell line, J-82 induces sensitivity to abemaciclib (Fig 2b).

The present disclosure relates generally to the fields of medicine, oncology, and immunology. More particular, the disclosure relates to antibodies that LILRBs and can treat cancers, including leukemias.

Background

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia of adults. Despite continuous treatment, most patients relapse within 5 years. To effectively treat acute leukemia, new molecular targets and therapeutic approaches must be identified. Recently, the inventors cloned the human leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2 (LILRB2) as a receptor for several angiopoietin-like proteins (Angptls) (Zheng et al, 2012). The LILRB family receptors are type I transmembrane glycoprotein containing extracellular Ig-like domains that bind ligands and intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and are classified as inhibitory receptors because ITIM motifs can recruit phosphatases SHP-1, SHP-2, or SHIP to negatively regulate immune cell activation (Takai et al , 2011; Daeron et al, 2008; Katz et al, 2006). It is known that LILRBs are expressed on myeloid cells and certain other hematopoietic cells (Mori et al, 2008). Surprisingly, the inventors have shown that PirB, the mouse ortholog of LILRB2, and LAIR1, a close related ITIM-receptor, are expressed by AML stem cells (AML-SCs) and support AML development (Zheng et al , 2012; Kang et al , in press). Although counterintuitive, this result is consistent with the generally immune-suppressive and thus tumor-promoting roles of the inhibitory receptors in the immune system (Ma et al, 2011).
In recent work, the inventors found that several members of the LILRB family are highly expressed on AML cells, and their expression negatively correlates with the overall survival of human AML patients. LILRBs are expressed by both AML-SCs and some differentiated acute leukemia cells (including AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL). There is no defect in the normal hematopoietic development in mice that do not express any individual LILRB tested. Interestingly, however, knockout of individual LILRBs reversed leukemia development in a number of AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) mouse models and abolished AML-SCs (Zheng et al , 2012; Kang et al , in press; also see PCT/US 13/43431). In addition, inhibition of expression of several LILRBs individually in different human leukemia cell lines in culture and blocked leukemia development in xenografted mice (Kang et al , in press; also see PCT/US 13/43431).
The inventors have determined that some leukemia stem cells express high levels of ITIM-inhibitory receptors including LILRBs. The current treatment options for patients with acute leukemia, including chemotherapy, do not efficiently target cancer stem cells because these inhibitory receptors enable the leukemia stem cells to survive the conventional therapies eventually resulting in tumor relapse. The inventors theorize that LILRB signaling represents an ideal target for treating AML for several reasons: 1) several LILRBs are essential to the survival of AML cells including AML-SCs; 2) knockout of an individual LILRB does not result in overt defects in normal hematopoiesis; and 3) inhibition of LILRB activity stimulates immunity and indirectly boosts anti-tumor effects.', NULL, CAST(N'2017-07-20T14:39:59.413' AS DateTime), 1562, N'WO2016144728', 1, N'ANTI-LILRB ANTIBODIES AND THEIR USE IN DETECTING AND TREATING CANCER', 1, 7197, CAST(N'2020-11-30' AS Date))

It has been estimated that 20% of the population in the United States suffers from gastroesophageal reflux and that about 10% of these patients are diagnosed with BE. Commonly, BE is discovered during endoscopy for the evaluation of GERD symptoms.
It is documented that longstanding exposure of esophageal mucosa to gastric acidity results in cellular damage of the stratified squamous epithelium and creates an abnormal environment, which stimulates repair in the form of intestinal epithelial metaplasia.  The consequence is that the stratified squamous epithelium, which physiologically lines the esophageal mucosa, is replaced by a pathological, specialized columnar epithelium which is neither of cardiac nor of stomach type, but exhibits features of the intestinal type of epithelium. This pathological type of epithelium usually demonstrates DNA alterations that predispose to malignancy. The alterations in BE are histologically classified into three categories, depending on whether or not they exhibit dysplasia: (1) BE without dysplasia; (2) BE with low-grade dysplasia; and (3) BE with high-grade dysplasia (HGD). In BE with HGD, dysplasia is confined to the mucosa without crossing the basement membrane. If dysplasia extends beyond the basement membrane into the lamina propria through the in-coming lymphatic network, it is defined as intramucosal (superficial) adenocarcinoma, whereas if it invades the muscularis mucosa layer it becomes invasive adenocarcinoma. Thus, BE with HGD is considered a precursor of invasive adenocarcinoma.
Six to twenty percent of patients with BE and HGD are at greatest risk of developing adenocarcinoma within a short period of time, ranging from 17 to 35 mo at follow-up. Esophagectomy specimens from patients with BE and HGD revealed invasive adenocarcinoma in 30%-40% of cases. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with BE and HGD developed esophageal adenocarcinoma with an average incidence of 6 every 100 patients per year, during the first 1.5 to 7 years of endoscopic surveillance. Furthermore, the majority of esophageal adenocarcinoma is thought to have evolved from cells that have undergone Barrett’s metaplasia.
BE is also classified into two categories according to the extent of intestinal metaplasia above the gastroesophageal junction: (1) long segment BE, if the extent of the intestinal epithelium is greater than 3 cm; and (2) short segment BE, if it is less than 3 cm.  Among patients who undergo endoscopy for symptoms of GERD, the incidence of long segment BE is 3%-5%, whereas short segment BE occurs in 10%-15%. Whether long and short segment BE share the same pathogenetic alterations or the same predisposition to malignancy still remains unclear; however, both conditions are currently treated in the same manner.
A common, and invasive, means for treating certain Barrett’s Esophagus patients is through endoscopic ablation therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation, photodynamic therapy or cryoablation of esophageal tissue.  However, despite a reasonably high percentage of patients that reach remission after therapy, many of those patients relapse with in a few years.  For other patients, whether because they are refractory to ablactive therapy or ineligible due to severe co-morbidities, there are even fewer treatment options and those that exist still leave a significant need for more effective therapies with better results and/or long durations of remission.', NULL, CAST(N'2019-10-04T16:26:23.050' AS DateTime), NULL, N'62/839152', 2, N'METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATING ESOPHAGEAL METAPLASIA, DYSPLASIA AND CARCINOMAS, INCLUDING BARRETT''S ESOPHAGUS', NULL, 6516, CAST(N'2020-02-29' AS Date))

These genes are targeted by EZH2 inhibitors and underlie the tumor-suppressive effects of these compounds. EZH2 inhibition can also sensitize cancers that overexpress EZH2-regulated DNA damage repair genes to genotoxic agents. This application also includes a potential combination therapy that administers both EZH2 inhibitor and PARP-1 inhibitor or their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives.
In an embodiment, the PARP-1 inhibitor is one or more of olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, talazoparib, veliparib (ABT-888), iniparib and pamiparib, BMN673, INO-1001, E7016 (GPI21016), CEP8963, MK4827, CEP-9722. The EZH2 inhibitor is one or more of tazemetostat, 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), EPZ005687, EI1, GSK126, EP6438, GSK343, GSK503, CPI-1205, Constellation Compound 3, +OR-S2 and +UNC1999. The list of signature genes that can be used to predict patients’ responses to the proposed combination therapy are derived from 5 KEGG pathways, i.e., base excision repair, mismatch repair, Fanconi anemia pathway, homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining. The most important genes in the list include CDCA3, CKS2, MUTYH, POLE3, TACC3, RFC4, RFC2, REV3L, POLD4, MLH1, FANCG, FANCF, FANCL, BRCA1, POLE2, BRIP1, PRKDC, POLI, NEIL1, PARP3, POLM, LIG1, BARD1, DCLRE1C, UBE2T, MPG, FEN1, RBBP8, RFC3, BRCC3, FANCD2, RFC5, POLE, POLB, HES1, RAD54L, DNTT, MSH2, POLD1, BRCA2, POLE4, PARP1, MLH3, NEIL3, BLM, RPA2, RPA3, RAD50, NTHL1, LIG4, POLH, XRCC4, NEIL2, RMI2, FANCI, UNG, MSH6, EXO1, ATM, NBN, RMI1, HMGB1, RAD51C. The way to evaluate changes in their expression is to take their mean expression followed by comparison with the expression of normal control tissues. A significant increase of mean gene signature expression value is defined as higher than mean plus 1 standard deviation of expression distribution from normal tissues. The exact threshold and units would change according to different platform.
Since the inventors’ study proposed methods of predicting cancer patients’ responses to EZH2 inhibitors, one such method was described in the application, which includes obtaining a biological sample containing cancer cells from a patient and evaluating the expression of a group of DNA repair genes as a predictor of sensitivity of the cancer cells to EZH2 inhibitors, either as monotherapy or in combination with DNA damaging agents. Specifically, expression levels of a plurality of biomarkers in a first biological specimen from a patient are compared to expression levels of the plurality of biomarkers in a second biological specimen from the patient, wherein the second biological specimen is obtained by exposing the first biological specimen to an EZH2 inhibitor and a change in the expression levels of the plurality of biomarkers is interpreted as therapeutic efficacy of the EZH2 inhibitor.

It has been estimated that 20% of the population in the United States suffers from gastroesophageal reflux and that about 10% of these patients are diagnosed with BE. Commonly, BE is discovered during endoscopy for the evaluation of GERD symptoms.
It is documented that longstanding exposure of esophageal mucosa to gastric acidity results in cellular damage of the stratified squamous epithelium and creates an abnormal environment, which stimulates repair in the form of intestinal epithelial metaplasia.  The consequence is that the stratified squamous epithelium, which physiologically lines the esophageal mucosa, is replaced by a pathological, specialized columnar epithelium which is neither of cardiac nor of stomach type, but exhibits features of the intestinal type of epithelium. This pathological type of epithelium usually demonstrates DNA alterations that predispose to malignancy. The alterations in BE are histologically classified into three categories, depending on whether or not they exhibit dysplasia: (1) BE without dysplasia; (2) BE with low-grade dysplasia; and (3) BE with high-grade dysplasia (HGD). In BE with HGD, dysplasia is confined to the mucosa without crossing the basement membrane. If dysplasia extends beyond the basement membrane into the lamina propria through the in-coming lymphatic network, it is defined as intramucosal (superficial) adenocarcinoma, whereas if it invades the muscularis mucosa layer it becomes invasive adenocarcinoma. Thus, BE with HGD is considered a precursor of invasive adenocarcinoma.
Six to twenty percent of patients with BE and HGD are at greatest risk of developing adenocarcinoma within a short period of time, ranging from 17 to 35 mo at follow-up. Esophagectomy specimens from patients with BE and HGD revealed invasive adenocarcinoma in 30%-40% of cases. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with BE and HGD developed esophageal adenocarcinoma with an average incidence of 6 every 100 patients per year, during the first 1.5 to 7 years of endoscopic surveillance. Furthermore, the majority of esophageal adenocarcinoma is thought to have evolved from cells that have undergone Barrett’s metaplasia.
BE is also classified into two categories according to the extent of intestinal metaplasia above the gastroesophageal junction: (1) long segment BE, if the extent of the intestinal epithelium is greater than 3 cm; and (2) short segment BE, if it is less than 3 cm.  Among patients who undergo endoscopy for symptoms of GERD, the incidence of long segment BE is 3%-5%, whereas short segment BE occurs in 10%-15%. Whether long and short segment BE share the same pathogenetic alterations or the same predisposition to malignancy still remains unclear; however, both conditions are currently treated in the same manner.
A common, and invasive, means for treating certain Barrett’s Esophagus patients is through endoscopic ablation therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation, photodynamic therapy or cryoablation of esophageal tissue.  However, despite a reasonably high percentage of patients that reach remission after therapy, many of those patients relapse with in a few years.  For other patients, whether because they are refractory to ablactive therapy or ineligible due to severe co-morbidities, there are even fewer treatment options and those that exist still leave a significant need for more effective therapies with better results and/or long durations of remission.', NULL, CAST(N'2019-10-04T16:26:23.050' AS DateTime), NULL, N'62/839152', 2, N'METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATING ESOPHAGEAL METAPLASIA, DYSPLASIA AND CARCINOMAS, INCLUDING BARRETT''S ESOPHAGUS', 1, 7305, CAST(N'2020-11-30' AS Date))

These genes are targeted by EZH2 inhibitors and underlie the tumor-suppressive effects of these compounds. EZH2 inhibition can also sensitize cancers that overexpress EZH2-regulated DNA damage repair genes to genotoxic agents. This application also includes a potential combination therapy that administers both EZH2 inhibitor and PARP-1 inhibitor or their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives.
In an embodiment, the PARP-1 inhibitor is one or more of olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, talazoparib, veliparib (ABT-888), iniparib and pamiparib, BMN673, INO-1001, E7016 (GPI21016), CEP8963, MK4827, CEP-9722. The EZH2 inhibitor is one or more of tazemetostat, 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), EPZ005687, EI1, GSK126, EP6438, GSK343, GSK503, CPI-1205, Constellation Compound 3, +OR-S2 and +UNC1999. The list of signature genes that can be used to predict patients’ responses to the proposed combination therapy are derived from 5 KEGG pathways, i.e., base excision repair, mismatch repair, Fanconi anemia pathway, homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining. The most important genes in the list include CDCA3, CKS2, MUTYH, POLE3, TACC3, RFC4, RFC2, REV3L, POLD4, MLH1, FANCG, FANCF, FANCL, BRCA1, POLE2, BRIP1, PRKDC, POLI, NEIL1, PARP3, POLM, LIG1, BARD1, DCLRE1C, UBE2T, MPG, FEN1, RBBP8, RFC3, BRCC3, FANCD2, RFC5, POLE, POLB, HES1, RAD54L, DNTT, MSH2, POLD1, BRCA2, POLE4, PARP1, MLH3, NEIL3, BLM, RPA2, RPA3, RAD50, NTHL1, LIG4, POLH, XRCC4, NEIL2, RMI2, FANCI, UNG, MSH6, EXO1, ATM, NBN, RMI1, HMGB1, RAD51C. The way to evaluate changes in their expression is to take their mean expression followed by comparison with the expression of normal control tissues. A significant increase of mean gene signature expression value is defined as higher than mean plus 1 standard deviation of expression distribution from normal tissues. The exact threshold and units would change according to different platform.
Since the inventors’ study proposed methods of predicting cancer patients’ responses to EZH2 inhibitors, one such method was described in the application, which includes obtaining a biological sample containing cancer cells from a patient and evaluating the expression of a group of DNA repair genes as a predictor of sensitivity of the cancer cells to EZH2 inhibitors, either as monotherapy or in combination with DNA damaging agents. Specifically, expression levels of a plurality of biomarkers in a first biological specimen from a patient are compared to expression levels of the plurality of biomarkers in a second biological specimen from the patient, wherein the second biological specimen is obtained by exposing the first biological specimen to an EZH2 inhibitor and a change in the expression levels of the plurality of biomarkers is interpreted as therapeutic efficacy of the EZH2 inhibitor.

As a result, the AuNP evaporates a very thin volume (nanometer size) of water in the immediate surrounding medium. This in turn creates vapor nanobubbles that expand and then collapse within nanoseconds to produce a localized mechanical impact without significant global heating beyond the nanobubble.
Here, the inventors designed and synthesized plasmonic AuNP to target the TJ protein, JAM-A, a critical component of the blood-brain barrier. By using picosecond pulsed laser, they generated plasmonic nanobubbles by activating TJ-targeting AuNPs. As shown in schematic (Figure 1), these nanobubbles then acted as “nano-sonicators” to locally disrupt the tight junction thus temporarily compromising the blood-brain barrier. The inventors tested and confirmed their hypothesis both in vitro using a cell monolayer model and in vivo.
This approach offers a new approach to brain drug delivery, such as for treating brain cancers. Specifically, for brain tumors such as glioblastoma, the optically triggered blood-brain barrier opening allows the use of more effective chemotherapy drugs from a large pool of anticancer drugs, previously unavailable due to their inability to pass through blood-brain barrier. With more effective therapies for hard to treat brain tumors, the inventors expect substantially reduced side effects that the brain cancer patients currently suffer from chemotherapy treatment, and as well improved survival and quality of life.', NULL, CAST(N'2020-04-22T10:50:53.170' AS DateTime), 1477, N'62/685,910 Provisional', 2, N'METHOD FOR OPTICAL OPENING OF THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER', NULL, 6744, CAST(N'2020-05-31' AS Date))

Its unrivaled sensitivity and signal to noise ratio have enabled the observation of endocytois, exocytosis, trafficking and virus dynamics. TIRF is based on total internal reflection and the resulting evanescent field that is generated at a refractive index interface (here glass to water). The evanescent field only penetrates around 100nm into the sample, creating a very thin illuminated optical section. In practice, the evanescent field is however scattered by the sample, resulting in out-of-focus blur and increased background. By design of a TIRF microscope, there is no mechanism to reject such blur, as all fluorescence light emitted by the microscope is captured.

The present disclosure relates generally to the fields of medicine, oncology, and immunology. More particular, the disclosure relates to antibodies that LILRBs and can treat cancers, including leukemias.

Background

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia of adults. Despite continuous treatment, most patients relapse within 5 years. To effectively treat acute leukemia, new molecular targets and therapeutic approaches must be identified. Recently, the inventors cloned the human leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2 (LILRB2) as a receptor for several angiopoietin-like proteins (Angptls) (Zheng et al, 2012). The LILRB family receptors are type I transmembrane glycoprotein containing extracellular Ig-like domains that bind ligands and intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and are classified as inhibitory receptors because ITIM motifs can recruit phosphatases SHP-1, SHP-2, or SHIP to negatively regulate immune cell activation (Takai et al , 2011; Daeron et al, 2008; Katz et al, 2006). It is known that LILRBs are expressed on myeloid cells and certain other hematopoietic cells (Mori et al, 2008). Surprisingly, the inventors have shown that PirB, the mouse ortholog of LILRB2, and LAIR1, a close related ITIM-receptor, are expressed by AML stem cells (AML-SCs) and support AML development (Zheng et al , 2012; Kang et al , in press). Although counterintuitive, this result is consistent with the generally immune-suppressive and thus tumor-promoting roles of the inhibitory receptors in the immune system (Ma et al, 2011).
In recent work, the inventors found that several members of the LILRB family are highly expressed on AML cells, and their expression negatively correlates with the overall survival of human AML patients. LILRBs are expressed by both AML-SCs and some differentiated acute leukemia cells (including AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL). There is no defect in the normal hematopoietic development in mice that do not express any individual LILRB tested. Interestingly, however, knockout of individual LILRBs reversed leukemia development in a number of AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) mouse models and abolished AML-SCs (Zheng et al , 2012; Kang et al , in press; also see PCT/US 13/43431). In addition, inhibition of expression of several LILRBs individually in different human leukemia cell lines in culture and blocked leukemia development in xenografted mice (Kang et al , in press; also see PCT/US 13/43431).
The inventors have determined that some leukemia stem cells express high levels of ITIM-inhibitory receptors including LILRBs. The current treatment options for patients with acute leukemia, including chemotherapy, do not efficiently target cancer stem cells because these inhibitory receptors enable the leukemia stem cells to survive the conventional therapies eventually resulting in tumor relapse. The inventors theorize that LILRB signaling represents an ideal target for treating AML for several reasons: 1) several LILRBs are essential to the survival of AML cells including AML-SCs; 2) knockout of an individual LILRB does not result in overt defects in normal hematopoiesis; and 3) inhibition of LILRB activity stimulates immunity and indirectly boosts anti-tumor effects.', NULL, CAST(N'2017-07-20T14:39:59.413' AS DateTime), 1562, N'WO2016144728', 1, N'ANTI-LILRB ANTIBODIES AND THEIR USE IN DETECTING AND TREATING CANCER', 1, 7931, CAST(N'2021-11-30' AS Date))

The data revealed that the COPD distal airways are populated by a highly stereotyped triad of clonogenic cells (referred to as "Cluster 2", "Cluster 3" and "Cluster 4" stem cells, and collectively to as "pathogenic lung epithelial stem cells" or "PLESCs") in addition to the normal clonogenic cell type (referred to as "Cluster 1" stem cells, or "normal regenerative stem cells") that predominates control lungs. The inventors demonstrate that the Cluster 2, 3, and 4 clonogenic cells are stably committed to the mucous and squamous metaplastic fates and autonomously drive mucus hypersecretion, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic programs akin to those implicated in COPD pathology. In addition, the data shows that a similar triad of clonogenic cells in COPD also exists in control adult and 13-, 14-, and 17-week fetal lung, albeit at low ratios to the predominant distal airway clone type seen in normal lung. Thus the variant clones predate any disease state and yet have features that could contribute to the emergence, pathology, or progression of COPD as a function of their numbers.', NULL, CAST(N'2020-09-24T16:31:08.490' AS DateTime), 1874, N'62/992,282', 2, N'Methods and Compositions for Treating Inflammatory pulmonary disorders', NULL, 7305, CAST(N'2020-11-30' AS Date))

Here we show that IL-15 also mediates homeostatic priming of CD8 T cells for antigen-stimulated activation, which is controlled by a deubiquitinase, Otub1. Otub1 deficiency greatly enhances responses of CD8 T cells to IL-15, rendering naïve CD8 T cells hyper-sensitive to antigen stimulation characterized by enhanced metabolic reprograming and effector functions. Otub1 also controls the maturation and activation of NK cells. Importantly, Otub1 deletion profoundly enhances anticancer immunity in mouse models of cancer immunotherapy. Using a T cell adoptive therapy model, we further show that Otub1 deletion is able to substantially improve the efficacy of cancer treatment based on autologous T cell transfer. Our findings suggest that Otub1 controls the activation of CD8 T cells and NK cells by functioning as a checkpoint of IL-15-mediated priming, establishing Otub1 as a new target for cancer immunotherapy.

It has been estimated that 20% of the population in the United States suffers from gastroesophageal reflux and that about 10% of these patients are diagnosed with BE. Commonly, BE is discovered during endoscopy for the evaluation of GERD symptoms.
It is documented that longstanding exposure of esophageal mucosa to gastric acidity results in cellular damage of the stratified squamous epithelium and creates an abnormal environment, which stimulates repair in the form of intestinal epithelial metaplasia.  The consequence is that the stratified squamous epithelium, which physiologically lines the esophageal mucosa, is replaced by a pathological, specialized columnar epithelium which is neither of cardiac nor of stomach type, but exhibits features of the intestinal type of epithelium. This pathological type of epithelium usually demonstrates DNA alterations that predispose to malignancy. The alterations in BE are histologically classified into three categories, depending on whether or not they exhibit dysplasia: (1) BE without dysplasia; (2) BE with low-grade dysplasia; and (3) BE with high-grade dysplasia (HGD). In BE with HGD, dysplasia is confined to the mucosa without crossing the basement membrane. If dysplasia extends beyond the basement membrane into the lamina propria through the in-coming lymphatic network, it is defined as intramucosal (superficial) adenocarcinoma, whereas if it invades the muscularis mucosa layer it becomes invasive adenocarcinoma. Thus, BE with HGD is considered a precursor of invasive adenocarcinoma.
Six to twenty percent of patients with BE and HGD are at greatest risk of developing adenocarcinoma within a short period of time, ranging from 17 to 35 mo at follow-up. Esophagectomy specimens from patients with BE and HGD revealed invasive adenocarcinoma in 30%-40% of cases. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with BE and HGD developed esophageal adenocarcinoma with an average incidence of 6 every 100 patients per year, during the first 1.5 to 7 years of endoscopic surveillance. Furthermore, the majority of esophageal adenocarcinoma is thought to have evolved from cells that have undergone Barrett’s metaplasia.
BE is also classified into two categories according to the extent of intestinal metaplasia above the gastroesophageal junction: (1) long segment BE, if the extent of the intestinal epithelium is greater than 3 cm; and (2) short segment BE, if it is less than 3 cm.  Among patients who undergo endoscopy for symptoms of GERD, the incidence of long segment BE is 3%-5%, whereas short segment BE occurs in 10%-15%. Whether long and short segment BE share the same pathogenetic alterations or the same predisposition to malignancy still remains unclear; however, both conditions are currently treated in the same manner.
A common, and invasive, means for treating certain Barrett’s Esophagus patients is through endoscopic ablation therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation, photodynamic therapy or cryoablation of esophageal tissue.  However, despite a reasonably high percentage of patients that reach remission after therapy, many of those patients relapse with in a few years.  For other patients, whether because they are refractory to ablactive therapy or ineligible due to severe co-morbidities, there are even fewer treatment options and those that exist still leave a significant need for more effective therapies with better results and/or long durations of remission.', NULL, CAST(N'2019-10-04T16:26:23.050' AS DateTime), NULL, N'62/839152', 2, N'METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATING ESOPHAGEAL METAPLASIA, DYSPLASIA AND CARCINOMAS, INCLUDING BARRETT''S ESOPHAGUS', 1, 8027, CAST(N'2022-02-28' AS Date))

The inventors demonstrate that the Cluster 2, 3, and 4 clonogenic cells are stably committed to the mucous and squamous metaplastic fates and autonomously drive mucus hypersecretion, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic programs akin to those implicated in COPD pathology. In addition, the data shows that a similar triad of clonogenic cells in COPD also exists in control adult and 13-, 14-, and 17-week fetal lung, albeit at low ratios to the predominant distal airway clone type seen in normal lung.

The disclosed framework is a pan-cancer early detection tool that is able to augment the small signals emitted from early stage cancer by analyzing and understanding the changes in the blood T cell repertoire. The disclosed systems and methods provide for the ability to detect, at the earliest stages, cancers that many current technologies are unable to identify – for example, kidney cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer. As discussed herein, in addition to the improved capabilities for early-stage cancer detection, the disclosed framework provides capabilities for improving the accuracy of detecting late-stage cancer in patients, as, for example, it can be used together with radiographic images to increase their diagnostic accuracy (in addition to the existing traditional methods mentioned above).
[6]     The disclosed systems and methods embody the first immune-based cancer detection techniques or technology. That is, when an individual has cancer, the immune system will react by proliferation of cancer-specific T cells and circulate them in the blood and lymph system. While this bodily reaction is naturally occurring, its presentation in, and the analysis of blood data is not, and thus an improved automated framework is necessary to perform such analysis.  The disclosed framework uses a specific automation technique to detect cancer signals from the signatures of the peripheral immune repertoire, which can be performed with higher accuracy than present automated methodologies even at the early stages of the disease.
[7]     According to some embodiments of the instant disclosure, the disclosed framework executes a novel machine learning algorithm that can predict cancer status based on a patient’s peripheral blood TCR repertoire. As discussed in more detail below, starting with a normal amount of blood sample (e.g., 3-10 ml), the disclosed framework can perform deep TCR sequencing of the genomic DNA of the white blood cells, which enables the detection (prediction or determination) of cancer-associated TCRs independent of tumor antigens. This is then leveraged in order to identify a patient’s “cancer score”, which is reflective of their immune repertoire. The score is an output of an automated process which output represents a robust biomarker for both early and late-stage cancers across diverse diseases, and is predictive of patient response to checkpoint blockade therapies. Thus, the determined score is a strong indicator of whether a patient has cancer, and to what degree.

The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium has tangibly stored thereon, or tangibly encoded thereon, computer readable instructions that when executed by a device cause at least one processor to perform a method for a novel and improved framework for diagnosing cancer status with peripheral blood TCR repertoire.

This invention consists of a method to deglycosylate membrane proteins in order to improve antibody binding to proteins, which leads to a better prediction of response to therapy. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of membrane proteins including immune checkpoint molecules is a common method for providing critical information for clinical diagnosis and therapeutic response, and accurate staining of target proteins is critical for this. We developed a novel method to resolve the enigma through protein deglycosylation before antibody-based detection assays. Using PD-L1 as an example, our results show that removal of carbohydrate decoration from the surface antigens can improve anti-PD-L1 antibody binding and detection. This advanced methodology through antigen retrieving can be applied to other membrane protein detection for those antibodies generated by recognizing extracellular domain of the antigens. Additional data (see attached) shows that the anti-PD-L1 signal correlated with patient response to therapy only when the samples were deglycosylated prior to IHC staining in lung cancer samples. At the moment there is no protein deglycosylation methodology developed so far for a general application in antibody-based detection of surface antigens, although the protein deglycosylation is a well-known concept for glycobiology. Thus, our invention is entirely new and the first one to use the protein deglycosylation concept and methodology to enhance the antibody capability to recognize PD-L1 protein. It can improve the detection efficiency of those developed anti-PD-L1 antibodies in research laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, clinical diagnostic groups, and hospitals, to have a better prediction of patient response for the goal of precision medicine in immune oncology.', NULL, CAST(N'2020-10-19T10:13:07.850' AS DateTime), NULL, N'PCT/US2019/036073', 2, N'Removal of N-Linked Glycosylation Enhances PD-L1 Detection and Predicts Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Therapeutic Efficacy', NULL, 7385, CAST(N'2021-02-28' AS Date))

Cell competition has been proposed as a surveillance mechanism to ensure normal development and maintain tissue homeostasis, and also been suggested to act as a barrier to interspecies chimerism. To date, however, cell competition has not been examined in an interspecies context during early development due to lack of an in vitro model. Here, we develop an interspecies pluripotent stem cell (PSC) co-culture strategy and uncover a previously unknown mode of cell competition between species. Interspecies PSC competition occurs during primed but not naïve pluripotency, and between evolutionarily distant species. Through comparative transcriptome analysis, we found genes related to the NF-κB signaling pathway, among others, were upregulated in loser cells. Genetic inactivation of a core component (P65) and an upstream regulator (MYD88, downstream of TLR signaling) of NF-κB complex in loser cells could overcome interspecies PSC competition. In addition, we found genetic inactivation of P53 signaling also promoted loser cell survival. Suppressing interspecies PSC competition improved survival and chimerism of loser cells from a distant species in early mouse embryos. Our study discovers a new paradigm of cell competition and paves the way for studying evolutionarily conserved cell competition mechanisms during early mammalian development.

Here we show that IL-15 also mediates homeostatic priming of CD8 T cells for antigen-stimulated activation, which is controlled by a deubiquitinase, Otub1. Otub1 deficiency greatly enhances responses of CD8 T cells to IL-15, rendering naïve CD8 T cells hyper-sensitive to antigen stimulation characterized by enhanced metabolic reprograming and effector functions. Otub1 also controls the maturation and activation of NK cells. Importantly, Otub1 deletion profoundly enhances anticancer immunity in mouse models of cancer immunotherapy. Using a T cell adoptive therapy model, we further show that Otub1 deletion is able to substantially improve the efficacy of cancer treatment based on autologous T cell transfer.

Cell competition has been proposed as a surveillance mechanism to ensure normal development and maintain tissue homeostasis, and also been suggested to act as a barrier to interspecies chimerism. To date, however, cell competition has not been examined in an interspecies context during early development due to lack of an in vitro model. Here, we develop an interspecies pluripotent stem cell (PSC) co-culture strategy and uncover a previously unknown mode of cell competition between species. Interspecies PSC competition occurs during primed but not naïve pluripotency, and between evolutionarily distant species. Through comparative transcriptome analysis, we found genes related to the NF-κB signaling pathway, among others, were upregulated in loser cells. Genetic inactivation of a core component (P65) and an upstream regulator (MYD88, downstream of TLR signaling) of NF-κB complex in loser cells could overcome interspecies PSC competition. In addition, we found genetic inactivation of P53 signaling also promoted loser cell survival. Suppressing interspecies PSC competition improved survival and chimerism of loser cells from a distant species in early mouse embryos. Our study discovers a new paradigm of cell competition and paves the way for studying evolutionarily conserved cell competition mechanisms during early mammalian development.

The disclosed framework is a pan-cancer early detection tool that is able to augment the small signals emitted from early stage cancer by analyzing and understanding the changes in the blood T cell repertoire. The disclosed systems and methods provide for the ability to detect, at the earliest stages, cancers that many current technologies are unable to identify – for example, kidney cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer. As discussed herein, in addition to the improved capabilities for early-stage cancer detection, the disclosed framework provides capabilities for improving the accuracy of detecting late-stage cancer in patients, as, for example, it can be used together with radiographic images to increase their diagnostic accuracy (in addition to the existing traditional methods mentioned above).
[6]     The disclosed systems and methods embody the first immune-based cancer detection techniques or technology. That is, when an individual has cancer, the immune system will react by proliferation of cancer-specific T cells and circulate them in the blood and lymph system. While this bodily reaction is naturally occurring, its presentation in, and the analysis of blood data is not, and thus an improved automated framework is necessary to perform such analysis.  The disclosed framework uses a specific automation technique to detect cancer signals from the signatures of the peripheral immune repertoire, which can be performed with higher accuracy than present automated methodologies even at the early stages of the disease.
[7]     According to some embodiments of the instant disclosure, the disclosed framework executes a novel machine learning algorithm that can predict cancer status based on a patient’s peripheral blood TCR repertoire. As discussed in more detail below, starting with a normal amount of blood sample (e.g., 3-10 ml), the disclosed framework can perform deep TCR sequencing of the genomic DNA of the white blood cells, which enables the detection (prediction or determination) of cancer-associated TCRs independent of tumor antigens. This is then leveraged in order to identify a patient’s “cancer score”, which is reflective of their immune repertoire. The score is an output of an automated process which output represents a robust biomarker for both early and late-stage cancers across diverse diseases, and is predictive of patient response to checkpoint blockade therapies. Thus, the determined score is a strong indicator of whether a patient has cancer, and to what degree.

This invention consists of a method to deglycosylate membrane proteins in order to improve antibody binding to proteins, which leads to a better prediction of response to therapy. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of membrane proteins including immune checkpoint molecules is a common method for providing critical information for clinical diagnosis and therapeutic response, and accurate staining of target proteins is critical for this. We developed a novel method to resolve the enigma through protein deglycosylation before antibody-based detection assays. Using PD-L1 as an example, our results show that removal of carbohydrate decoration from the surface antigens can improve anti-PD-L1 antibody binding and detection. This advanced methodology through antigen retrieving can be applied to other membrane protein detection for those antibodies generated by recognizing extracellular domain of the antigens. Additional data (see attached) shows that the anti-PD-L1 signal correlated with patient response to therapy only when the samples were deglycosylated prior to IHC staining in lung cancer samples. At the moment there is no protein deglycosylation methodology developed so far for a general application in antibody-based detection of surface antigens, although the protein deglycosylation is a well-known concept for glycobiology. Thus, our invention is entirely new and the first one to use the protein deglycosylation concept and methodology to enhance the antibody capability to recognize PD-L1 protein. It can improve the detection efficiency of those developed anti-PD-L1 antibodies in research laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, clinical diagnostic groups, and hospitals, to have a better prediction of patient response for the goal of precision medicine in immune oncology.', NULL, CAST(N'2020-10-19T10:13:07.850' AS DateTime), NULL, N'PCT/US2019/036073', 2, N'Removal of N-Linked Glycosylation Enhances PD-L1 Detection and Predicts Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Therapeutic Efficacy', 1, 8211, CAST(N'2022-02-28' AS Date))

As a result, the AuNP evaporates a very thin volume (nanometer size) of water in the immediate surrounding medium. This in turn creates vapor nanobubbles that expand and then collapse within nanoseconds to produce a localized mechanical impact without significant global heating beyond the nanobubble.
Here, the inventors designed and synthesized plasmonic AuNP to target the TJ protein, JAM-A, a critical component of the blood-brain barrier. By using picosecond pulsed laser, they generated plasmonic nanobubbles by activating TJ-targeting AuNPs. As shown in schematic (Figure 1), these nanobubbles then acted as “nano-sonicators” to locally disrupt the tight junction thus temporarily compromising the blood-brain barrier. The inventors tested and confirmed their hypothesis both in vitro using a cell monolayer model and in vivo.
This approach offers a new approach to brain drug delivery, such as for treating brain cancers. Specifically, for brain tumors such as glioblastoma, the optically triggered blood-brain barrier opening allows the use of more effective chemotherapy drugs from a large pool of anticancer drugs, previously unavailable due to their inability to pass through blood-brain barrier. With more effective therapies for hard to treat brain tumors, the inventors expect substantially reduced side effects that the brain cancer patients currently suffer from chemotherapy treatment, and as well improved survival and quality of life.', NULL, CAST(N'2020-04-22T10:50:53.170' AS DateTime), 1477, N'62/685,910 Provisional', 2, N'METHOD FOR OPTICAL OPENING OF THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER', 1, 8563, CAST(N'2022-05-31' AS Date))

The present disclosure relates generally to the fields of medicine, oncology, and immunology. More particular, the disclosure relates to antibodies that LILRBs and can treat cancers, including leukemias.

Background

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia of adults. Despite continuous treatment, most patients relapse within 5 years. To effectively treat acute leukemia, new molecular targets and therapeutic approaches must be identified. Recently, the inventors cloned the human leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2 (LILRB2) as a receptor for several angiopoietin-like proteins (Angptls) (Zheng et al, 2012). The LILRB family receptors are type I transmembrane glycoprotein containing extracellular Ig-like domains that bind ligands and intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and are classified as inhibitory receptors because ITIM motifs can recruit phosphatases SHP-1, SHP-2, or SHIP to negatively regulate immune cell activation (Takai et al , 2011; Daeron et al, 2008; Katz et al, 2006). It is known that LILRBs are expressed on myeloid cells and certain other hematopoietic cells (Mori et al, 2008). Surprisingly, the inventors have shown that PirB, the mouse ortholog of LILRB2, and LAIR1, a close related ITIM-receptor, are expressed by AML stem cells (AML-SCs) and support AML development (Zheng et al , 2012; Kang et al , in press). Although counterintuitive, this result is consistent with the generally immune-suppressive and thus tumor-promoting roles of the inhibitory receptors in the immune system (Ma et al, 2011).
In recent work, the inventors found that several members of the LILRB family are highly expressed on AML cells, and their expression negatively correlates with the overall survival of human AML patients. LILRBs are expressed by both AML-SCs and some differentiated acute leukemia cells (including AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL). There is no defect in the normal hematopoietic development in mice that do not express any individual LILRB tested. Interestingly, however, knockout of individual LILRBs reversed leukemia development in a number of AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) mouse models and abolished AML-SCs (Zheng et al , 2012; Kang et al , in press; also see PCT/US 13/43431). In addition, inhibition of expression of several LILRBs individually in different human leukemia cell lines in culture and blocked leukemia development in xenografted mice (Kang et al , in press; also see PCT/US 13/43431).
The inventors have determined that some leukemia stem cells express high levels of ITIM-inhibitory receptors including LILRBs. The current treatment options for patients with acute leukemia, including chemotherapy, do not efficiently target cancer stem cells because these inhibitory receptors enable the leukemia stem cells to survive the conventional therapies eventually resulting in tumor relapse. The inventors theorize that LILRB signaling represents an ideal target for treating AML for several reasons: 1) several LILRBs are essential to the survival of AML cells including AML-SCs; 2) knockout of an individual LILRB does not result in overt defects in normal hematopoiesis; and 3) inhibition of LILRB activity stimulates immunity and indirectly boosts anti-tumor effects.', NULL, CAST(N'2017-07-20T14:39:59.413' AS DateTime), 1562, N'WO2016144728', 1, N'ANTI-LILRB ANTIBODIES AND THEIR USE IN DETECTING AND TREATING CANCER', 1, 8728, CAST(N'2022-05-31' AS Date))

Broadening the application of CAR-T cells to include solid tumors as targets, however, has proven more challenging. One of the main obstacles  to overcome for this therapy to be successful in solid tumors is the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is composed of cells and secreted cytokines that are potently immunosuppressive and block the activity of CART cells. In many solid tumors, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are the main contributors to induction and maintenance of T cell suppression. the accumulation of MDSCs at the tumor site has been associated with poor prognosis, increased disease burden and importantly, poor response to immunotherapies. Armed with these facts, investigators have focused on finding ways to eliminate MDSCs from the TME. Most strategies are non-specific and have significant side effects. However, a targeted approach is to use an agonist mAb against TNF-related apoptosis induced ligand-receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2); a receptor expressed on MDSCs that activates apoptosis upon engagement with its soluble ligands. Our idea and approach was to engineer a receptor that engages with TRAIL-R2, therefore inducing apoptosis of MDSCs and at the same time provides a co-stimulatory signal to CART cells that improve their persistence and anti-tumor effects. For this receptor we used the scFv of a monoclonal antibody specific for TRAIL-R2 as the extracellular domain of the receptor and as signaling the intracellular domain of 4-1BB. We call this receptor TR2-41BB.  T cells engineered to express TR2-41BB are able to specifically eliminate MDSCs in vitro and in vivo show improved anti-tumor effects as well as higher proliferation and persistance at the tumor site compared to CART cells alone.', NULL, CAST(N'2021-09-27T14:44:41.757' AS DateTime), NULL, N'PCT/US2021/028437', 2, N'OVERCOMING THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT FOR CELL THERAPY BY TARGETING MYELOID DERIVED SUPPRESSOR CELLS THROUGH A TRAIL-R2 SPECIFIC RECEPTOR', NULL, 8089, CAST(N'2021-11-30' AS Date))

The multiple components of the strain sensors of the present disclosure that are responsible for capturing strain deformation are fabricated in a layer-on-layer fashion.  According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a bottom-up fabrication method is utilized in which a polymeric layer of millimeter thickness is fabricated on the top of a transparent glass substrate, followed by a nanometer thick poly(p-xylylene) polymer layer.  A ~50 to 100 nm metallic layer (e.g., aluminum, copper, silver, gold, or combinations of the same and like) is deposited over the aforementioned polymer composite substrate and enclosed by a micron-thick polymer layer on the top.  This fabrication stabilizes the interface between the metal and polymer substrate so that the nanometer thick metal film is wrinkle-free, residual-stress-free, and highly reflective.

Broadening the application of CAR-T cells to include solid tumors as targets, however, has proven more challenging. One of the main obstacles  to overcome for this therapy to be successful in solid tumors is the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is composed of cells and secreted cytokines that are potently immunosuppressive and block the activity of CART cells. In many solid tumors, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are the main contributors to induction and maintenance of T cell suppression. the accumulation of MDSCs at the tumor site has been associated with poor prognosis, increased disease burden and importantly, poor response to immunotherapies. Armed with these facts, investigators have focused on finding ways to eliminate MDSCs from the TME. Most strategies are non-specific and have significant side effects. However, a targeted approach is to use an agonist mAb against TNF-related apoptosis induced ligand-receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2); a receptor expressed on MDSCs that activates apoptosis upon engagement with its soluble ligands. Our idea and approach was to engineer a receptor that engages with TRAIL-R2, therefore inducing apoptosis of MDSCs and at the same time provides a co-stimulatory signal to CART cells that improve their persistence and anti-tumor effects. For this receptor we used the scFv of a monoclonal antibody specific for TRAIL-R2 as the extracellular domain of the receptor and as signaling the intracellular domain of 4-1BB. We call this receptor TR2-41BB.  T cells engineered to express TR2-41BB are able to specifically eliminate MDSCs in vitro and in vivo show improved anti-tumor effects as well as higher proliferation and persistance at the tumor site compared to CART cells alone.', NULL, CAST(N'2021-09-27T14:44:41.757' AS DateTime), NULL, N'PCT/US2021/028437', 2, N'OVERCOMING THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT FOR CELL THERAPY BY TARGETING MYELOID DERIVED SUPPRESSOR CELLS THROUGH A TRAIL-R2 SPECIFIC RECEPTOR', 1, 8878, CAST(N'2022-11-30' AS Date))

Here we show that IL-15 also mediates homeostatic priming of CD8 T cells for antigen-stimulated activation, which is controlled by a deubiquitinase, Otub1. Otub1 deficiency greatly enhances responses of CD8 T cells to IL-15, rendering naïve CD8 T cells hyper-sensitive to antigen stimulation characterized by enhanced metabolic reprograming and effector functions. Otub1 also controls the maturation and activation of NK cells. Importantly, Otub1 deletion profoundly enhances anticancer immunity in mouse models of cancer immunotherapy. Using a T cell adoptive therapy model, we further show that Otub1 deletion is able to substantially improve the efficacy of cancer treatment based on autologous T cell transfer.

The disclosed framework is a pan-cancer early detection tool that is able to augment the small signals emitted from early stage cancer by analyzing and understanding the changes in the blood T cell repertoire. The disclosed systems and methods provide for the ability to detect, at the earliest stages, cancers that many current technologies are unable to identify – for example, kidney cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer. As discussed herein, in addition to the improved capabilities for early-stage cancer detection, the disclosed framework provides capabilities for improving the accuracy of detecting late-stage cancer in patients, as, for example, it can be used together with radiographic images to increase their diagnostic accuracy (in addition to the existing traditional methods mentioned above).
[6]     The disclosed systems and methods embody the first immune-based cancer detection techniques or technology. That is, when an individual has cancer, the immune system will react by proliferation of cancer-specific T cells and circulate them in the blood and lymph system. While this bodily reaction is naturally occurring, its presentation in, and the analysis of blood data is not, and thus an improved automated framework is necessary to perform such analysis.  The disclosed framework uses a specific automation technique to detect cancer signals from the signatures of the peripheral immune repertoire, which can be performed with higher accuracy than present automated methodologies even at the early stages of the disease.
[7]     According to some embodiments of the instant disclosure, the disclosed framework executes a novel machine learning algorithm that can predict cancer status based on a patient’s peripheral blood TCR repertoire. As discussed in more detail below, starting with a normal amount of blood sample (e.g., 3-10 ml), the disclosed framework can perform deep TCR sequencing of the genomic DNA of the white blood cells, which enables the detection (prediction or determination) of cancer-associated TCRs independent of tumor antigens. This is then leveraged in order to identify a patient’s “cancer score”, which is reflective of their immune repertoire. The score is an output of an automated process which output represents a robust biomarker for both early and late-stage cancers across diverse diseases, and is predictive of patient response to checkpoint blockade therapies. Thus, the determined score is a strong indicator of whether a patient has cancer, and to what degree.

Abstract: Methods and devices for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of cancer, among other
uses. Methods and devices for the treatment and diagnosis of cancer are also provided that
include assessing and quantifying imperfect dsDNA break repair. The method may include
determining a deletion signal for a DNA-containing sample of a subject, wherein the deletion
signal comprises distributions of deletions (frequencies) of deletions with microhomologies of
different lengths at the deletion sites in a DNA sequence or genome of the subject or sample
thereof. The method may further include decomposing the deletion signal into components
corresponding to changes arising from: (1) DNA repair processes, (2) systematic effects due to
mapping personal deletion variants to reference genomes, and (3) false positive deletions
generated during sample preparation, sequencing, and analysis, and quantifying these
components to produce mutational signatures of defective HRR.', NULL, CAST(N'2021-11-24T20:38:17.457' AS DateTime), 2679, N'PCT/US21/49060', 2, N'ASSESSMENT AND QUANTIFICATION OF IMPERFECT dsDNA BREAK REPAIR

Cell competition has been proposed as a surveillance mechanism to ensure normal development and maintain tissue homeostasis, and also been suggested to act as a barrier to interspecies chimerism. To date, however, cell competition has not been examined in an interspecies context during early development due to lack of an in vitro model. Here, we develop an interspecies pluripotent stem cell (PSC) co-culture strategy and uncover a previously unknown mode of cell competition between species. Interspecies PSC competition occurs during primed but not naïve pluripotency, and between evolutionarily distant species. Through comparative transcriptome analysis, we found genes related to the NF-κB signaling pathway, among others, were upregulated in loser cells. Genetic inactivation of a core component (P65) and an upstream regulator (MYD88, downstream of TLR signaling) of NF-κB complex in loser cells could overcome interspecies PSC competition. In addition, we found genetic inactivation of P53 signaling also promoted loser cell survival. Suppressing interspecies PSC competition improved survival and chimerism of loser cells from a distant species in early mouse embryos. Our study discovers a new paradigm of cell competition and paves the way for studying evolutionarily conserved cell competition mechanisms during early mammalian development. Strategies we developed here may facilitate xeno-generation of tissues between evolutionary distant species.', NULL, CAST(N'2022-05-27T11:50:10.917' AS DateTime), 2446, N'PCT/US2021/014358', 2, N'Modulating NF-kB Signaling Pathway to Enhance Interspecies Chimerism Between Evolutionary Distant Species', 1, 9009, CAST(N'2022-08-31' AS Date))

This invention consists of a method to deglycosylate membrane proteins in order to improve antibody binding to proteins, which leads to a better prediction of response to therapy. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of membrane proteins including immune checkpoint molecules is a common method for providing critical information for clinical diagnosis and therapeutic response, and accurate staining of target proteins is critical for this. We developed a novel method to resolve the enigma through protein deglycosylation before antibody-based detection assays. Using PD-L1 as an example, our results show that removal of carbohydrate decoration from the surface antigens can improve anti-PD-L1 antibody binding and detection. This advanced methodology through antigen retrieving can be applied to other membrane protein detection for those antibodies generated by recognizing extracellular domain of the antigens. Additional data (see attached) shows that the anti-PD-L1 signal correlated with patient response to therapy only when the samples were deglycosylated prior to IHC staining in lung cancer samples. At the moment there is no protein deglycosylation methodology developed so far for a general application in antibody-based detection of surface antigens, although the protein deglycosylation is a well-known concept for glycobiology. Thus, our invention is entirely new and the first one to use the protein deglycosylation concept and methodology to enhance the antibody capability to recognize PD-L1 protein. It can improve the detection efficiency of those developed anti-PD-L1 antibodies in research laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, clinical diagnostic groups, and hospitals, to have a better prediction of patient response for the goal of precision medicine in immune oncology.', NULL, CAST(N'2020-10-19T10:13:07.850' AS DateTime), NULL, N'PCT/US2019/036073', 2, N'Removal of N-Linked Glycosylation Enhances PD-L1 Detection and Predicts Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Therapeutic Efficacy', 1, 9040, CAST(N'2023-02-28' AS Date))

[0005] Recognized herein is a need to provide an effective treatment for
metastatic cancer or metastatic diseases (e.g., late stage cancer) with improved
selectivity as well as reduced side effects. Recognized herein is also a need to
provide methods and systems for killing metastasized cells in a non-cytotoxic or
comfortable manner.
[0006] The present disclosure addresses various aspects of the abovementioned
needs by providing an immersion mechanotherapy. In particular, the provided
immersion mechanotherapy may manipulate signaling pathways specifically in
target cells such as cancer cells or metastasized cells to further treat diseases
associated with these signaling pathways in a non- cytotoxic, comfortable and
effective manner. The immersion mechanotherapy of the present disclosure may
provide a novel cancer treatment with high-selectivity or without introducing
negative side effects. The treatment may employ methods and systems to trigger the
apoptosis induced-cancer cell death utilizing ultrasound waves.
[0007] The present disclosure also provides systems and devices for
implementing the mechanotherapy in a user-friendly and uniform fashion. The
immersion mechanotherapy may be applied to a patient’s whole body, a body part
or selected portion of the body which is beneficially suitable for treating metastatic
diseases. In addition to treating cancer, the provided therapeutic systems or
methods may also promote wound healing, tissue repair and tissue regeneration.', NULL, CAST(N'2021-12-15T17:22:04.117' AS DateTime), NULL, N'17/515,025', 2, N'Systems and Methods for Immersion Mechanotherapy', NULL, 8325, CAST(N'2022-02-28' AS Date))

Methods and systems of the present disclosure may provide high-selectivity cancer treatment without introducing side effect. The methods and systems provided herein may address various drawbacks of conventional systems, including those recognized above. In some cases, these systems and methods may be capable of performing the novel treatment to trigger the apoptosis induced-cancer cell death in an automated and controlled manner.  The provided in situ cancer treatment can be well suited for various kinds of cancer. The treatment involves generating and imparting periodic forces to diseased tissue to introduce apoptosis only in cancer cells while promoting growth in normal cells. This may greatly improve the efficiency and efficacy of cancer treatment with drastically reduced side effect.
[0004]  The process of recognizing and responding to mechanical stimuli is critical for growth and function of cells.  Cells can respond to mechanical signals in the form of forces applied externally or generated by cell–matrix and cell–cell contacts.  Some of those mechanical signals can further regulate the cell death process.  Cancer cells and normal cells respond to mechanical stimuli differently. Cancer is a disease where the cells exhibit altered biomechanical properties. Early studies determined that cancer cells grew on soft agar whereas normal cells did not. More recent studies show that more than seventy-five percent of 40 randomly selected cancer lines lack the ability to sense rigidity of surrounding matrices.
[0005]  It is observed that apoptosis induced-cancer cell death can be triggered by periodic stretching of the cancer cells. Unlike conventional ultrasound ablation which causes cell death due to heat or high temperature, cancer cells treated by the provided methods and systems apoptose after low intensity, long periods of mechanical stimuli thereby reducing the damage to normal cells due to either thermal effects and/or cavitational effects. In particular, periodic forces are generated in a combination of duration, magnitude, and frequency that are sufficient to distort the internal cell organelles such that a mechanically-induced apoptotic process is triggered, while the generated periodic forces are small enough such that the normal cells and healthy tissues are not subjected to mechanical damage.', NULL, CAST(N'2021-12-15T17:46:17.010' AS DateTime), NULL, N'17607819', 2, N'Systems and Methods for Cancer Treatment', NULL, 8325, CAST(N'2022-02-28' AS Date))

It has been estimated that 20% of the population in the United States suffers from gastroesophageal reflux and that about 10% of these patients are diagnosed with BE. Commonly, BE is discovered during endoscopy for the evaluation of GERD symptoms.
It is documented that longstanding exposure of esophageal mucosa to gastric acidity results in cellular damage of the stratified squamous epithelium and creates an abnormal environment, which stimulates repair in the form of intestinal epithelial metaplasia.  The consequence is that the stratified squamous epithelium, which physiologically lines the esophageal mucosa, is replaced by a pathological, specialized columnar epithelium which is neither of cardiac nor of stomach type, but exhibits features of the intestinal type of epithelium. This pathological type of epithelium usually demonstrates DNA alterations that predispose to malignancy. The alterations in BE are histologically classified into three categories, depending on whether or not they exhibit dysplasia: (1) BE without dysplasia; (2) BE with low-grade dysplasia; and (3) BE with high-grade dysplasia (HGD). In BE with HGD, dysplasia is confined to the mucosa without crossing the basement membrane. If dysplasia extends beyond the basement membrane into the lamina propria through the in-coming lymphatic network, it is defined as intramucosal (superficial) adenocarcinoma, whereas if it invades the muscularis mucosa layer it becomes invasive adenocarcinoma. Thus, BE with HGD is considered a precursor of invasive adenocarcinoma.
Six to twenty percent of patients with BE and HGD are at greatest risk of developing adenocarcinoma within a short period of time, ranging from 17 to 35 mo at follow-up. Esophagectomy specimens from patients with BE and HGD revealed invasive adenocarcinoma in 30%-40% of cases. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with BE and HGD developed esophageal adenocarcinoma with an average incidence of 6 every 100 patients per year, during the first 1.5 to 7 years of endoscopic surveillance. Furthermore, the majority of esophageal adenocarcinoma is thought to have evolved from cells that have undergone Barrett’s metaplasia.
BE is also classified into two categories according to the extent of intestinal metaplasia above the gastroesophageal junction: (1) long segment BE, if the extent of the intestinal epithelium is greater than 3 cm; and (2) short segment BE, if it is less than 3 cm.  Among patients who undergo endoscopy for symptoms of GERD, the incidence of long segment BE is 3%-5%, whereas short segment BE occurs in 10%-15%. Whether long and short segment BE share the same pathogenetic alterations or the same predisposition to malignancy still remains unclear; however, both conditions are currently treated in the same manner.
A common, and invasive, means for treating certain Barrett’s Esophagus patients is through endoscopic ablation therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation, photodynamic therapy or cryoablation of esophageal tissue.  However, despite a reasonably high percentage of patients that reach remission after therapy, many of those patients relapse with in a few years.  For other patients, whether because they are refractory to ablactive therapy or ineligible due to severe co-morbidities, there are even fewer treatment options and those that exist still leave a significant need for more effective therapies with better results and/or long durations of remission.', NULL, CAST(N'2019-10-04T16:26:23.050' AS DateTime), NULL, N'62/839152', 2, N'METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATING ESOPHAGEAL METAPLASIA, DYSPLASIA AND CARCINOMAS, INCLUDING BARRETT''S ESOPHAGUS', 1, 9145, CAST(N'2023-05-31' AS Date))

The inventors demonstrate that the Cluster 2, 3, and 4 clonogenic cells are stably committed to the mucous and squamous metaplastic fates and autonomously drive mucus hypersecretion, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic programs akin to those implicated in COPD pathology. In addition, the data shows that a similar triad of clonogenic cells in COPD also exists in control adult and 13-, 14-, and 17-week fetal lung, albeit at low ratios to the predominant distal airway clone type seen in normal lung.

[0005] Recognized herein is a need to provide an effective treatment for
metastatic cancer or metastatic diseases (e.g., late stage cancer) with improved
selectivity as well as reduced side effects. Recognized herein is also a need to
provide methods and systems for killing metastasized cells in a non-cytotoxic or
comfortable manner.
[0006] The present disclosure addresses various aspects of the abovementioned
needs by providing an immersion mechanotherapy. In particular, the provided
immersion mechanotherapy may manipulate signaling pathways specifically in
target cells such as cancer cells or metastasized cells to further treat diseases
associated with these signaling pathways in a non- cytotoxic, comfortable and
effective manner. The immersion mechanotherapy of the present disclosure may
provide a novel cancer treatment with high-selectivity or without introducing
negative side effects. The treatment may employ methods and systems to trigger the
apoptosis induced-cancer cell death utilizing ultrasound waves.
[0007] The present disclosure also provides systems and devices for
implementing the mechanotherapy in a user-friendly and uniform fashion. The
immersion mechanotherapy may be applied to a patient’s whole body, a body part
or selected portion of the body which is beneficially suitable for treating metastatic
diseases. In addition to treating cancer, the provided therapeutic systems or
methods may also promote wound healing, tissue repair and tissue regeneration.', NULL, CAST(N'2021-12-15T17:22:04.117' AS DateTime), NULL, N'17/515,025', 2, N'Systems and Methods for Immersion Mechanotherapy', 1, 9171, CAST(N'2023-02-28' AS Date))

Methods and systems of the present disclosure may provide high-selectivity cancer treatment without introducing side effect. The methods and systems provided herein may address various drawbacks of conventional systems, including those recognized above. In some cases, these systems and methods may be capable of performing the novel treatment to trigger the apoptosis induced-cancer cell death in an automated and controlled manner.  The provided in situ cancer treatment can be well suited for various kinds of cancer. The treatment involves generating and imparting periodic forces to diseased tissue to introduce apoptosis only in cancer cells while promoting growth in normal cells. This may greatly improve the efficiency and efficacy of cancer treatment with drastically reduced side effect.
[0004]  The process of recognizing and responding to mechanical stimuli is critical for growth and function of cells.  Cells can respond to mechanical signals in the form of forces applied externally or generated by cell–matrix and cell–cell contacts.  Some of those mechanical signals can further regulate the cell death process.  Cancer cells and normal cells respond to mechanical stimuli differently. Cancer is a disease where the cells exhibit altered biomechanical properties. Early studies determined that cancer cells grew on soft agar whereas normal cells did not. More recent studies show that more than seventy-five percent of 40 randomly selected cancer lines lack the ability to sense rigidity of surrounding matrices.
[0005]  It is observed that apoptosis induced-cancer cell death can be triggered by periodic stretching of the cancer cells. Unlike conventional ultrasound ablation which causes cell death due to heat or high temperature, cancer cells treated by the provided methods and systems apoptose after low intensity, long periods of mechanical stimuli thereby reducing the damage to normal cells due to either thermal effects and/or cavitational effects. In particular, periodic forces are generated in a combination of duration, magnitude, and frequency that are sufficient to distort the internal cell organelles such that a mechanically-induced apoptotic process is triggered, while the generated periodic forces are small enough such that the normal cells and healthy tissues are not subjected to mechanical damage.', NULL, CAST(N'2021-12-15T17:46:17.010' AS DateTime), NULL, N'17607819', 2, N'Systems and Methods for Cancer Treatment', 1, 9171, CAST(N'2023-02-28' AS Date))

As a result, the AuNP evaporates a very thin volume (nanometer size) of water in the immediate surrounding medium. This in turn creates vapor nanobubbles that expand and then collapse within nanoseconds to produce a localized mechanical impact without significant global heating beyond the nanobubble.
Here, the inventors designed and synthesized plasmonic AuNP to target the TJ protein, JAM-A, a critical component of the blood-brain barrier. By using picosecond pulsed laser, they generated plasmonic nanobubbles by activating TJ-targeting AuNPs. As shown in schematic (Figure 1), these nanobubbles then acted as “nano-sonicators” to locally disrupt the tight junction thus temporarily compromising the blood-brain barrier. The inventors tested and confirmed their hypothesis both in vitro using a cell monolayer model and in vivo.
This approach offers a new approach to brain drug delivery, such as for treating brain cancers. Specifically, for brain tumors such as glioblastoma, the optically triggered blood-brain barrier opening allows the use of more effective chemotherapy drugs from a large pool of anticancer drugs, previously unavailable due to their inability to pass through blood-brain barrier.

Broadening the application of CAR-T cells to include solid tumors as targets, however, has proven more challenging. One of the main obstacles  to overcome for this therapy to be successful in solid tumors is the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is composed of cells and secreted cytokines that are potently immunosuppressive and block the activity of CART cells. In many solid tumors, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are the main contributors to induction and maintenance of T cell suppression. the accumulation of MDSCs at the tumor site has been associated with poor prognosis, increased disease burden and importantly, poor response to immunotherapies. Armed with these facts, investigators have focused on finding ways to eliminate MDSCs from the TME. Most strategies are non-specific and have significant side effects. However, a targeted approach is to use an agonist mAb against TNF-related apoptosis induced ligand-receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2); a receptor expressed on MDSCs that activates apoptosis upon engagement with its soluble ligands. Our idea and approach was to engineer a receptor that engages with TRAIL-R2, therefore inducing apoptosis of MDSCs and at the same time provides a co-stimulatory signal to CART cells that improve their persistence and anti-tumor effects. For this receptor we used the scFv of a monoclonal antibody specific for TRAIL-R2 as the extracellular domain of the receptor and as signaling the intracellular domain of 4-1BB. We call this receptor TR2-41BB.  T cells engineered to express TR2-41BB are able to specifically eliminate MDSCs in vitro and in vivo show improved anti-tumor effects as well as higher proliferation and persistance at the tumor site compared to CART cells alone.', NULL, CAST(N'2021-09-27T14:44:41.757' AS DateTime), NULL, N'PCT/US2021/028437', 2, N'OVERCOMING THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT FOR CELL THERAPY BY TARGETING MYELOID DERIVED SUPPRESSOR CELLS THROUGH A TRAIL-R2 SPECIFIC RECEPTOR', 1, 9695, CAST(N'2024-02-29' AS Date))

In some examples, an optical dichroic mirror may be utilized to split a light beam (e.g., microscope emission line) into shorter and longer wavelengths that can be recombined and arranged side-by-side on two halves of a camera sensor. Accordingly, images can be captured simultaneously (e.g., a first half of an example camera sensor may be used to capture an image associated with blue light and a second half of the example camera sensor may be used to capture an image associated with green light) in order to eliminate motion artifacts. Subsequently, image processing techniques can be used to combine or overlay the images and produce a final image output. However, this approach becomes less effective as the number of wavelengths, channels, and/or colors increases. In particular, as the number of wavelengths, channels, and/or colors increases, a light beam may be directed through many elements (e.g., optical glass) where each encounter introduces image distortions. For example, each light beam in a two-wavelength imaging system may encounter four mirrors, and each light beam in a four-wavelength system may encounter six mirrors. Said differently, the number of mirrors required increases with the number of wavelengths, thereby degrading the

performance of these systems. Additionally, these systems may require a large number of expensive elements (e.g., dichroic mirrors) making these devices costly, technically complex to produce, and impractical for capturing four or more colors.

[0041] There is a need for imaging systems that maximize imaging speed, sensitivity, quality, that can be made inexpensively for various applications. Embodiments of the present disclosure provide an imaging component that facilitates imaging of four or more colors simultaneously on a single camera sensor. In some embodiments, the imaging component is configured to be mounted at an emission port of an imaging apparatus (e.g., fluorescence microscope). In some embodiments, an arrangement of mirrors (e.g., three dichroic mirrors) split an incident light beam provided by the imaging apparatus (e.g., fluorescence microscope) into a plurality of secondary light beams (e.g., four secondary light beams that are each associated with a particular wavelength). In some embodiments, the imaging component comprises a plurality of lenses (e.g., relay lenses) that are each configured to collimate and direct one of the plurality of secondary light beams along a respective optical path within the imaging component. In some embodiments, the imaging component comprises a recombining element comprising a plurality of pickoff mirrors (e.g., D-shaped half-mirrors) that is configured to recombine the plurality of secondary light beams into a recombined light beam and direct the recombined light beam to an image sensor of the imaging apparatus.

The SMARCA4/2-mediated chromatin remodeling activity promotes transcription factor recruitment, enhancer activation, and eviction of other BAF component(s) (St Pierre and Kadoch (2017) Curr Opin Genet Dev 42: 56-67). About 20% of all cancers harbor defective chromatin remodelers (Kadoch et al. (2013) Nat Genet 45: 592-601; Shain and Pollack (2013) PLoS One 8: e55119). As such, SMARCA4 mutations are frequent in tumors such as atypical teratoid/rhabdoid (AT/RT) (Hasselblatt et al. (2014) Acta Neuropathol 128: 453-456), lung (Imielinski et al. (2012) Cell 150: 1107-1120), medulloblastoma (Parsons et al. (2011) Science 331: 435-439), and small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemia type (SCCOHT) (Witkowski et al. (2014) Nat Genet 46: 438-443), which suggests that SMARCA4 may serve as a tumor suppressor gene. However, recent studies have linked the overexpression of SMARCA4 to oncogenesis and tumor maintenance in several tumor types, e.g., leukemia (Shi et al. (2013) Genes Dev 27: 2648-2662; Buscarlet et al. (2014) Blood 123: 1720-1728), TNBC (Wu et al. (2015) J Cell Physiol 230: 2683-2694; Wu et al. (2016) Oncotarget 7: 27158-27175), melanoma (Keenen et al. (2010) Oncogene 29: 81-92), and neuroblastoma (Jubierre et al. (2016) Oncogene 35: 5179-5190) (FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B, modified from Valencia, A. et al. (2019) Nat Cell Biol 2: 152-161). The oncogenic role of BAF is also attributed to its perturbed function due to activity of residual BAF complexes (Helming et al. (2014) Cancer Cell 26: 309-317; Helming et al. (2014) Nat Med 20: 251-254). Thus, SMARCA2 has emerged as a synthetic lethal target in SMARCA4-deficient cancers (Hoffman et al. (2014) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 111: 3128-3133; Wilson et al. (2014) Mol Cell Biol 34: 1136-1144). These tumors incorporate SMARCA2 to compensate for SMARCA4’s loss of function as seen in non-small cell lung adenocarcinomas (NSCLCs) devoid of any alterations in known oncogenes such as EGFR and DDR2 (Hoffman et al. (2014) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 111: 3128-3133; Wilson et al. (2014) Mol Cell Biol 34: 1136-1144; Oike et al. (2013) Cancer Res 73: 5508-5518). SMARCA2 depletion in these tumors suppressed the growth of tumor xenografts. Therefore, targeting the paralog dependency of residual/aberrant BAF complexes via small molecule inhibitors offers an attractive and novel approach to Moreover, recent studies have also clarified the oncogenic role of BAF complexes and molecular relationship of an EWSFLI1 and BAFs in Ewing’s Sarcoma (EwS) (Boulay et al. (2017) Cell 171: 163-178 e119; Jayabal et al. (2021) Cell Rep 36: 109254). Molecular vulnerabilities that are based on synthetic lethality in cancers such as SWI/SNF deficiencies, may contribute to precision medicine. Of note, SMARCA2 does not seem to play a significant role in normal functioning of a cell as evident from fully viable SMARCA2 KO mice (Reyes et al. (1998) EMBO J 17: 6979-6991). Therefore, targeting SMARCA2 by small molecules should have minimal impact on normal cellular function. In addition, enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy in knockdown of SMARCA4 in breast (Wu et al. (2016) Oncotarget 7: 27158-27175) and pancreatic (Davidson et al. (2018) Oncotarget 9: 9608-9617) cancer models provide a proof-of-principle for a SMARCA4/2 inhibitor to act as an effective adjuvant therapy.  Despite the emergence of BAF inhibitors as a focus of drug discovery research (see, e.g., Papillon et al. (2018) J Med Chem 61: 10155-10172), there is no specific inhibitor of SMARCA2 available that could target its ATPase pocket or DNA binding surface.  Thus, there remains a need for compounds and compositions for treating cancers having a tumor with a mutant BAF chromatin remodeling complex, and methods of making and using same. In accordance with the purpose(s) of the invention, as embodied and broadly described in the invention filing, in one aspect, relates to substituted quinazoline-2,4-diamines in BAF-X-1 compound (CIDD-0149689) and compositions for use in the prevention and treatment of disorders associated with altered expression of SMARCA2 and/or SMARCA4 such as, for example, cancers having a tumor with a mutant BAF chromatin remodeling complex (e.g., sarcomas, carcinomas, hematological cancers, solid tumors, breast cancer, cervical cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, colorectal cancer, brain cancer, skin cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, testicular cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, endometrial cancer, melanoma, gliomas, leukemia, lymphoma, chronic myeloproliferative disorders, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasm, non-small cell lung carcinoma, plasma cell neoplasm (myeloma)).', NULL, CAST(N'2022-12-13T09:53:30.813' AS DateTime), NULL, N'US 63/297,158', 2, N'SMARCA2/4 INHIBITION AS A STRATEGY TO TREAT TUMORS THAT HARBOR ABERRANT BAF ASSEMBLIES', NULL, 9016, CAST(N'2023-02-28' AS Date))

Malignant tumors shed single cells (Circulating Tumor Cells, CTCs) or tumors chunks (CTC clusters) in blood which spread to distant tissues, causing 90% of tumor-associated deaths. While methods exist to detect CTCs in blood, they are rarely used. This is because CTC are apoptotic with a lifetime of about 2 hours and their enumeration alone does not affect patient management. Instead, oncologists need to know the molecular and genetic profile of tumors and their drug sensitivity to guide care. Most current effort is to detect circulating tumor DNA or rely on tumor tissue - “no meat no treat”. CTC clusters are like micro tumors and exhibit strong intercellular junctions that protect them from the immune system and shear damage. They can be cultured and analyzed to reflect the molecular, genetic and drug sensitivity profiles; however, retrieving these larger, heavier, and rare clusters from blood is technically challenging and no method is simple enough to be adopted. Our solution is to develop a simple, reliable, and very sensitive method to isolate live CTC clusters and obviate the need for tumor biopsy. Our technology involves the use of antibody-coated micro-scale bubbles that specifically bind to cancer cells in a blood sample and are dramatically inflated using our patented method. Analogous to frozen berries rising in a champagne glass when they accumulate bubbles, once the attached microbubbles (MBs) inflate they can lift the heavy clusters to the surface without the need for centrifugation.

According to certain aspects of the disclosure, microbubble compositions may be used for targeted drug delivery (in vitro or in vivo) of a payload to one or more target cells.  The payload may be delivered to the cytosol of the one or more targeted cells by targeted sonoporation.  The microbubbles may also be targeted to the one or more target cells by incorporation of targeting molecules, such as antibodies, that bind to the one or more target cells. For instance, the microbubbles may target professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells by the incorporation of an anti-CD11b antibody.

For example, the payload may be mRNA or plasmid DNA (pDNA) for use in applications such as nucleotide-based vaccines or gene therapies.

According to some aspects of the disclosure, such agonists may be used for the treatment of cancer, particularly solid tumor cancers (e.g., breast cancer, brain cancer, melanoma) or other cancers having solid masses (e.g., lymphomas). STING agonists may be used to activate downstream proinflammatory pathways in APCs that efficiently prime antigen-specific T cells, thus bridging innate and adaptive immune responses.

[0005] Recognized herein is a need to provide an effective treatment for
metastatic cancer or metastatic diseases (e.g., late stage cancer) with improved
selectivity as well as reduced side effects. Recognized herein is also a need to
provide methods and systems for killing metastasized cells in a non-cytotoxic or
comfortable manner.
[0006] The present disclosure addresses various aspects of the abovementioned
needs by providing an immersion mechanotherapy. In particular, the provided
immersion mechanotherapy may manipulate signaling pathways specifically in
target cells such as cancer cells or metastasized cells to further treat diseases
associated with these signaling pathways in a non- cytotoxic, comfortable and
effective manner. The immersion mechanotherapy of the present disclosure may
provide a novel cancer treatment with high-selectivity or without introducing
negative side effects. The treatment may employ methods and systems to trigger the

Methods and systems of the present disclosure may provide high-selectivity cancer treatment without introducing side effect. The methods and systems provided herein may address various drawbacks of conventional systems, including those recognized above. In some cases, these systems and methods may be capable of performing the novel treatment to trigger the apoptosis induced-cancer cell death in an automated and controlled manner.  The provided in situ cancer treatment can be well suited for various kinds of cancer. The treatment involves generating and imparting periodic forces to diseased tissue to introduce apoptosis only in cancer cells while promoting growth in normal cells. This may greatly improve the efficiency and efficacy of cancer treatment with drastically reduced side effect.
[0004]  The process of recognizing and responding to mechanical stimuli is critical for growth and function of cells.  Cells can respond to mechanical signals in the form of forces applied externally or generated by cell–matrix and cell–cell contacts.  Some of those mechanical signals can further regulate the cell death process.  Cancer cells and normal cells respond to mechanical stimuli differently. Cancer is a disease where the cells exhibit altered biomechanical properties. Early studies determined that cancer cells grew on soft agar whereas normal cells did not. More recent studies show that more than seventy-five percent of 40 randomly selected cancer lines lack the ability to sense rigidity of surrounding matrices.
[0005]  It is observed that apoptosis induced-cancer cell death can be triggered by periodic stretching of the cancer cells. Unlike conventional ultrasound ablation which causes cell death due to heat or high temperature, cancer cells treated by the provided methods and systems apoptose after low intensity, long periods of mechanical stimuli thereby reducing the damage to normal cells due to either thermal effects and/or cavitational effects. In particular, periodic forces are generated in a combination of duration, magnitude, and frequency that are sufficient to distort the internal cell organelles such that a mechanically-induced apoptotic process is triggered, while the generated periodic forces are small enough such that the normal cells and healthy tissues are not subjected to mechanical damage.', NULL, CAST(N'2021-12-15T17:46:17.010' AS DateTime), NULL, N'17607819', 2, N'Systems and Methods for Cancer Treatment', 1, 10008, CAST(N'2024-02-29' AS Date))

The formulation consist of spermine-modified polymers conjugated onto a microbubble shell using thiol-maleimide click chemistry. Having a cationic polymer such as spermine-labeled dextran (Spe-Dex) or polyspermine on the surface on the lipid shell allows for greater loading and tighter binding of negatively charged molecules such as DNA or other nucleotides. Polyspermine and spermine-labeled dextran polymers have not been included in microbubble formulations before and is unique to our platform.

Malignant tumors shed single cells (Circulating Tumor Cells, CTCs) or tumors chunks (CTC clusters) in blood which spread to distant tissues, causing 90% of tumor-associated deaths. While methods exist to detect CTCs in blood, they are rarely used. This is because CTC are apoptotic with a lifetime of about 2 hours and their enumeration alone does not affect patient management. Instead, oncologists need to know the molecular and genetic profile of tumors and their drug sensitivity to guide care. Most current effort is to detect circulating tumor DNA or rely on tumor tissue - “no meat no treat”. CTC clusters are like micro tumors and exhibit strong intercellular junctions that protect them from the immune system and shear damage. They can be cultured and analyzed to reflect the molecular, genetic and drug sensitivity profiles; however, retrieving these larger, heavier, and rare clusters from blood is technically challenging and no method is simple enough to be adopted. Our solution is to develop a simple, reliable, and very sensitive method to isolate live CTC clusters and obviate the need for tumor biopsy. Our technology involves the use of antibody-coated micro-scale bubbles that specifically bind to cancer cells in a blood sample and are dramatically inflated using our patented method. Analogous to frozen berries rising in a champagne glass when they accumulate bubbles, once the attached microbubbles (MBs) inflate they can lift the heavy clusters to the surface without the need for centrifugation. Our product consists of phospholipid-stabilized gaseous or liquid particles of perfluorocarbon added sequentially to a blood sample in a plastic syringe.', NULL, CAST(N'2023-01-20T15:50:49.503' AS DateTime), NULL, N'OI2023-00458', 2, N'Increased Buoyancy using Microbubbles and Nanodroplets for Cell Clusters and Circulating Tumor Cells Retrieval', 1, 10013, NULL)

According to certain aspects of the disclosure, microbubble compositions may be used for targeted drug delivery (in vitro or in vivo) of a payload to one or more target cells.  The payload may be delivered to the cytosol of the one or more targeted cells by targeted sonoporation.  The microbubbles may also be targeted to the one or more target cells by incorporation of targeting molecules, such as antibodies, that bind to the one or more target cells. For instance, the microbubbles may target professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells by the incorporation of an anti-CD11b antibody.  The payload may comprise any suitable agent that can be loaded onto the surface of the microbubbles.  For example, the payload may be mRNA or plasmid DNA (pDNA) for use in applications such as nucleotide-based vaccines or gene therapies.  According to some aspects, the payload may be an agonist of the cGAS–STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway.
According to some aspects of the disclosure, such agonists may be used for the treatment of cancer, particularly solid tumor cancers (e.g., breast cancer, brain cancer, melanoma) or other cancers having solid masses (e.g., lymphomas). STING agonists may be used to activate downstream proinflammatory pathways in APCs that efficiently prime antigen-specific T cells, thus bridging innate and adaptive immune responses. Doing so can result in systemic antitumor immunity and/or antitumor memory responses. According to some aspects, the microbubble composition may be used as a therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of cancer.', NULL, CAST(N'2023-01-20T15:55:36.287' AS DateTime), NULL, N'3873-03', 2, N'Microbubble-assisted Ultrasound-guided Immunotherapy of Cancer (MUSIC)', 1, 10013, NULL)

Dynamic range refers to the difference in concentration between the most abundant and least abundant molecular species in a sample. A high dynamic range means that the levels of certain molecules are significantly higher than others, which can pose challenges in accurate sequencing and data analysis. In NGS, the DNA or RNA is fragmented and sequenced, and then the sequence reads are aligned to a reference genome or transcriptome. However, a small fraction of high-abundance molecular species take over a large fraction of sequencing reads; while the vast majority of low-abundance species only share a tiny fraction of the sequencing reads in the sequencing data, which limits the accuracy and completeness of the analysis.
High dynamic range samples can also require more sequencing depth and coverage to capture the full range of expression levels accurately. This can result in higher sequencing costs, as more reads are required to ensure that the data is reliable and representative of the sample. Moreover, high dynamic range samples can also require more extensive data analysis, including normalization and statistical modeling, to account for the differences in expression levels and identify meaningful patterns and associations.
As such, technologies are in great need that can help reduce the challenge of high dynamic range and improve the accuracy and efficiency of NGS analysis, ultimately saving costs and enabling more comprehensive and meaningful insights into biological quantification, including, e.g., gene expression profiling and cell type analysis.

[0005] Recognized herein is a need to provide an effective treatment for
metastatic cancer or metastatic diseases (e.g., late stage cancer) with improved
selectivity as well as reduced side effects. Recognized herein is also a need to
provide methods and systems for killing metastasized cells in a non-cytotoxic or
comfortable manner.
[0006] The present disclosure addresses various aspects of the abovementioned
needs by providing an immersion mechanotherapy. In particular, the provided
immersion mechanotherapy may manipulate signaling pathways specifically in
target cells such as cancer cells or metastasized cells to further treat diseases
associated with these signaling pathways in a non- cytotoxic, comfortable and
effective manner. The immersion mechanotherapy of the present disclosure may
provide a novel cancer treatment with high-selectivity or without introducing
negative side effects. The treatment may employ methods and systems to trigger the
apoptosis induced-cancer cell death utilizing ultrasound waves.
[0007] The present disclosure also provides systems and devices for
implementing the mechanotherapy in a user-friendly and uniform fashion. The
immersion mechanotherapy may be applied to a patient’s whole body, a body part
or selected portion of the body which is beneficially suitable for treating metastatic
diseases. In addition to treating cancer, the provided therapeutic systems or
methods may also promote wound healing, tissue repair and tissue regeneration.', NULL, CAST(N'2021-12-15T17:22:04.117' AS DateTime), NULL, N'17/515,025', 2, N'Systems and Methods for Immersion Mechanotherapy', 1, 10751, NULL)

Methods and systems of the present disclosure may provide high-selectivity cancer treatment without introducing side effect. The methods and systems provided herein may address various drawbacks of conventional systems, including those recognized above. In some cases, these systems and methods may be capable of performing the novel treatment to trigger the apoptosis induced-cancer cell death in an automated and controlled manner.  The provided in situ cancer treatment can be well suited for various kinds of cancer. The treatment involves generating and imparting periodic forces to diseased tissue to introduce apoptosis only in cancer cells while promoting growth in normal cells. This may greatly improve the efficiency and efficacy of cancer treatment with drastically reduced side effect.
[0004]  The process of recognizing and responding to mechanical stimuli is critical for growth and function of cells.  Cells can respond to mechanical signals in the form of forces applied externally or generated by cell–matrix and cell–cell contacts.  Some of those mechanical signals can further regulate the cell death process.  Cancer cells and normal cells respond to mechanical stimuli differently. Cancer is a disease where the cells exhibit altered biomechanical properties. Early studies determined that cancer cells grew on soft agar whereas normal cells did not. More recent studies show that more than seventy-five percent of 40 randomly selected cancer lines lack the ability to sense rigidity of surrounding matrices.
[0005]  It is observed that apoptosis induced-cancer cell death can be triggered by periodic stretching of the cancer cells. Unlike conventional ultrasound ablation which causes cell death due to heat or high temperature, cancer cells treated by the provided methods and systems apoptose after low intensity, long periods of mechanical stimuli thereby reducing the damage to normal cells due to either thermal effects and/or cavitational effects. In particular, periodic forces are generated in a combination of duration, magnitude, and frequency that are sufficient to distort the internal cell organelles such that a mechanically-induced apoptotic process is triggered, while the generated periodic forces are small enough such that the normal cells and healthy tissues are not subjected to mechanical damage.', NULL, CAST(N'2021-12-15T17:46:17.010' AS DateTime), NULL, N'17607819', 2, N'Systems and Methods for Cancer Treatment', 1, 10751, NULL)

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the worst prognosis among the subtypes of BC. Currently, chemotherapy alone or in combination with immune checkpoint blockade is the standard of care. Obese patients with TNBC display worse outcome with higher chance of chemoresistance, increased risk of relapse and poor survival. The underlying mechanisms for this remain unclear, although evidence indicates its association with chronic inflammation. PanͲNOS Inhibitor LͲNMMA in combination with Docetaxel Enhances Antitumor Effect in ObesityͲ associated Triple Negative Breast Cancer Obesity is associated with increased risk of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Obese patients with TNBC have worse outcomes compared to patients with normal weight. Both obesity and TNBC are associated with chronic inflammation including elevated nitric oxide (NO). In a recently completed Phase I/II clinical trial using a panͲNOS inhibitor LͲNMMA in combination with chemotherapy docetaxel in chemorefractory and metastatic TNBC, a higher response rate was observed in obese patients. Furthermore, tumor microenvironment analysis from responders revealed a neutrophil phenotype shift from protumor N2 to antitumor N1. We thus hypothesize that combining panͲNOS inhibitor LͲNMMA with docetaxel can modulate neutrophil mediated pathways, and further enhance antitumor effect in obese mice with TNBC. Experimental Methods: ThreeͲweek old syngeneic female C57/black mice were randomized to high fat diet (HFD, 18% protein, 21% carbohydrates, and 61% fat, n=50) and normal diet (ND, 20% protein, 70% carbohydrates, and 10% fat, n=50) for 10 weeks. Mouse weights were measured weekly. After 10 weeks on their respective diets, glucose tolerance test, serum cytokine and leptin analysis were performed. At week 13, TNBC E0771 tumor cells (1 X 105 ) were injected into the right mammary fat pads. Tumor progression was monitored twice weekly and tumor volume [0.5 × (long dimension) × (short dimension)2 ] was calculated. Once the tumorreached 80Ͳ100 mm3 , mice in both HFD and ND groups were randomized to vehicle [saline, intraperitoneal (IP), n=10], docetaxel (20 mg/kg, IP, n=10), LͲNMMA (400 mg/kg on day 1, 200 mg/kg on days 2Ͳ5, n=10), docetaxel and LͲNMMA combination (same doses and schedule as in single agent groups, n=10). Tumor volume was measured throughout the experiment and tumor growth was calculated (tumor volume on day X/tumor volume at baseline). RNA sequencing of tumors from vehicle and combination groups in HFD and ND (n=6 in each arm) was performed (Azenta/Genewiz, NJ) and BioJupies was utilized for pathway analysis. GraphPad Software (La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to perform twoͲtailed Student’s t test and ANOVA statistical analysis.

This shift in metabolism—a facet of the Warburg effect—results in accumulation of extracellular H+ and, in some cases, elevated serum lactate. Acidification of the tumor microenvironment is associated with several tumor features including increased local aggressiveness, tendency towards metastasis, and chemoresistance. Congruent with this phenomenon, both noninvasive imaging techniques mapping tumor pH as well as biomarkers associated with tumor acidosis are being explored as factors to recognize malignant tumors and for prognostication and guidance of therapy.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the worst prognosis among the subtypes of BC. Currently, chemotherapy alone or in combination with immune checkpoint blockade is the standard of care. Obese patients with TNBC display worse outcome with higher chance of chemoresistance, increased risk of relapse and poor survival. The underlying mechanisms for this remain unclear, although evidence indicates its association with chronic inflammation. PanͲNOS Inhibitor LͲNMMA in combination with Docetaxel Enhances Antitumor Effect in ObesityͲ associated Triple Negative Breast Cancer Obesity is associated with increased risk of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Obese patients with TNBC have worse outcomes compared to patients with normal weight. Both obesity and TNBC are associated with chronic inflammation including elevated nitric oxide (NO). In a recently completed Phase I/II clinical trial using a panͲNOS inhibitor LͲNMMA in combination with chemotherapy docetaxel in chemorefractory and metastatic TNBC, a higher response rate was observed in obese patients. Furthermore, tumor microenvironment analysis from responders revealed a neutrophil phenotype shift from protumor N2 to antitumor N1. We thus hypothesize that combining panͲNOS inhibitor LͲNMMA with docetaxel can modulate neutrophil mediated pathways, and further enhance antitumor effect in obese mice with TNBC. Experimental Methods: ThreeͲweek old syngeneic female C57/black mice were randomized to high fat diet (HFD, 18% protein, 21% carbohydrates, and 61% fat, n=50) and normal diet (ND, 20% protein, 70% carbohydrates, and 10% fat, n=50) for 10 weeks. Mouse weights were measured weekly. After 10 weeks on their respective diets, glucose tolerance test, serum cytokine and leptin analysis were performed. At week 13, TNBC E0771 tumor cells (1 X 105 ) were injected into the right mammary fat pads. Tumor progression was monitored twice weekly and tumor volume [0.5 × (long dimension) × (short dimension)2 ] was calculated. Once the tumorreached 80Ͳ100 mm3 , mice in both HFD and ND groups were randomized to vehicle [saline, intraperitoneal (IP), n=10], docetaxel (20 mg/kg, IP, n=10), LͲNMMA (400 mg/kg on day 1, 200 mg/kg on days 2Ͳ5, n=10), docetaxel and LͲNMMA combination (same doses and schedule as in single agent groups, n=10). Tumor volume was measured throughout the experiment and tumor growth was calculated (tumor volume on day X/tumor volume at baseline). RNA sequencing of tumors from vehicle and combination groups in HFD and ND (n=6 in each arm) was performed (Azenta/Genewiz, NJ) and BioJupies was utilized for pathway analysis. GraphPad Software (La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to perform twoͲtailed Student’s t test and ANOVA statistical analysis.

Malignant tumors shed single cells (Circulating Tumor Cells, CTCs) or tumors chunks (CTC clusters) in blood which spread to distant tissues, causing 90% of tumor-associated deaths. While methods exist to detect CTCs in blood, they are rarely used. This is because CTC are apoptotic with a lifetime of about 2 hours and their enumeration alone does not affect patient management. Instead, oncologists need to know the molecular and genetic profile of tumors and their drug sensitivity to guide care. Most current effort is to detect circulating tumor DNA or rely on tumor tissue - “no meat no treat”. CTC clusters are like micro tumors and exhibit strong intercellular junctions that protect them from the immune system and shear damage. They can be cultured and analyzed to reflect the molecular, genetic and drug sensitivity profiles; however, retrieving these larger, heavier, and rare clusters from blood is technically challenging and no method is simple enough to be adopted. Our solution is to develop a simple, reliable, and very sensitive method to isolate live CTC clusters and obviate the need for tumor biopsy. Our technology involves the use of antibody-coated micro-scale bubbles that specifically bind to cancer cells in a blood sample and are dramatically inflated using our patented method. Analogous to frozen berries rising in a champagne glass when they accumulate bubbles, once the attached microbubbles (MBs) inflate they can lift the heavy clusters to the surface without the need for centrifugation.

According to certain aspects of the disclosure, microbubble compositions may be used for targeted drug delivery (in vitro or in vivo) of a payload to one or more target cells.  The payload may be delivered to the cytosol of the one or more targeted cells by targeted sonoporation.  The microbubbles may also be targeted to the one or more target cells by incorporation of targeting molecules, such as antibodies, that bind to the one or more target cells. For instance, the microbubbles may target professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells by the incorporation of an anti-CD11b antibody.  The payload may comprise any suitable agent that can be loaded onto the surface of the microbubbles.  For example, the payload may be mRNA or plasmid DNA (pDNA) for use in applications such as nucleotide-based vaccines or gene therapies.  According to some aspects, the payload may be an agonist of the cGAS–STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway.
According to some aspects of the disclosure, such agonists may be used for the treatment of cancer, particularly solid tumor cancers (e.g., breast cancer, brain cancer, melanoma) or other cancers having solid masses (e.g., lymphomas). STING agonists may be used to activate downstream proinflammatory pathways in APCs that efficiently prime antigen-specific T cells, thus bridging innate and adaptive immune responses. Doing so can result in systemic antitumor immunity and/or antitumor memory responses.
